FOREWORD
</p>

<p>
The story of Pierre Radisson, which is herein related, has passed into
history.  That he was the first white man to reach the Mississippi, after
De Soto, is now admitted.  It was he who founded the Hudson's Bay
Company, and who opened up the great Northwest to the world,
receiving the basest of ingratitude in return.
</p>

<p>
The materials and facts used in this narrative I owe in part to Agnes
C. Laut, who has rescued him from oblivion and given him his rightful
place in history.  The manner of his death no man knows to this day,
but it is hard to imagine this world-wandered dying in his bed in London
town; one likes to think of him as finding the peace of his "heart's
desire" in the far land which he knew and loved and served so
well.&mdash;<i>H. Bedford-Jones</i>.

CHAPTER I.
<br /><br />
WHAT WE FOUND ON THE MOOR.
</h3>

<p>
My father cocked up one eye at the
heavens and stroked his heavy
beard, and, as the storm was all
but over, he growled assent in the Gaelic
tongue that we of the west used among
ourselves.
</p>

<p>
"Aye, come along, Davie.  We'll have
work to find the sheep and get them
together after this blow.  Belike they are
huddled up in some corner of the moor&mdash;over
beyond the Glowerie-gap, no doubt."
</p>

<p>
So blithely enough I whistled to Grim,
and the three of us set off across the moors,
while mother stood at the door and waved
us a cheery farewell.  Little she thought
what burden we would fetch back with us
that day!  The great storm had blown
itself out, and as we went along I asked
permission to go down by the cliffs that
afternoon and hunt for washed-up wonders
of the ocean.
</p>

<p>
"Not you, lad," replied my father in
his stern fashion, yet kindly enough.
"There is work and to spare at home.
Besides, the cliffs are no place for you this
day.  There'll be wreckers out betwixt here
and Rathesby."
</p>

<p>
So with that I fell silent, wishing with
all my heart that I might see the wreckers
at work.  For I was but a boy of nine
and the life of a wrecker seemed to me
to be the greatest in all the world.  Little
I knew of the sore work that was done
along the west coast that day!
</p>

<p>
Years before, my great-grandfather, a
MacDonald of the isles, had come across
to the mainland and settled on Ayrby farm,
and on this same stead I had spent my
nine years.  All my life had been one of
peace and quietness, but I knew full well
that the old claymore hanging beside the
fireplace could not say as much.
</p>

<p>
For my father, Fergus MacDonald, had
married late in life and my mother had
come out of the south to wed him.  I
had heard strange whispers of the manner
of that wedding.  It was said, and my father
never denied it, that he had been one of
those who, many years before, had hoisted
the blue banner of the Covenant and
ridden behind the great prophet Cameron,
even to the end.  Then, when the
Covenant was shattered by the king's troops,
he had fled into the hills of the south, and
when the hunting was done and a new
King come to the throne, he had brought
home as his wife, the woman who had
sheltered and hidden him in her father's
barn.
</p>

<p>
How true these things were I never
knew, but my father's fame had spread
afar.  In this year of grace 1701 the days
of the Covenant were all but over.  The
order of things was shifting; rumors were
flying abroad that the Stuart was coming
to his own ere long, and that all wide
Scotland would rise behind him to a man.
</p>

<p>
Of this my thoughts were busy as we
strode over the heather, side by side.  Grim
following us sedately and inconspicuously,
as a sheep dog should when he has age and
experience.  I always respected Grim more
and liked him less than the younger brood
of dogs, for he seemed to have somewhat
of the dour, silent, purposeful sternness
of my father in his nature, and was ever
rebuking me for my very boyishness.
</p>

<p>
"Come, Davie," said my father suddenly,
"we'll cut off a mile by going down
beside the cliffs.  Like enough we will
strike on a few of the lambs among the
bowlders, where there would be shelter."
</p>

<p>
This set my mind back on the sheep once
more, and I followed him meekly but happily
to the cliff-path over the sea.  Fifteen
miles to the north lay the little port of
Rathesby, and on rare occasions I would
go thither with my father and enjoy myself
hugely, watching the fishermen and sailors
swaggering through the cobbled streets,
and hearing strange tongues&mdash;English and
Irish, and sometimes a snatch of Dutch or
French.  I knew English well enough, and
south-land English at that, while my
mother had taught me a good knowledge
of French; but the honest Gaelic was our
home speech and this I knew best of all,
and loved best.
</p>

<p>
Our path, to give it that distinction,
followed the winding edge of the cliff, where
many a gully and ravine led down to the
beach below.  I cast longing glances at
these, and once saw a shattered spar driving
on the rocks, but was careful to betray
naught of the eagerness that was in me.
When my father Fergus had once said a
thing, there was no naysaying it, which
was a lesson I had learned long before.
</p>

<p>
Of a sudden Grim made a little dash
around me and planted himself in the path
before us.  He made no sound, but he was
gazing across the moors, and to avoid
stepping on him we stopped perforce.  It was
an old trick of his, thus to give us warning,
and I have heard that in the old days
Grim and Grim's father had accompanied
more than one fleeing Covenanter safely
through the hills to shelter.
</p>

<p>
Now these tales leaped into my mind
with full force at a muttered exclamation
from my father, and I saw a strange sight.
The sun, in the east, was just breaking
through the storm clouds, lighting up the
rolling heather a quarter-mile beyond us.
There, full in its gleam, was a tiny splotch
of scarlet.
</p>

<p>
The old days must have returned on my
father, for as I glanced at him I saw his
hand leap to his side.  But the old
claymore hung there no longer, and his face
relaxed.
</p>

<p>
"What is it, Grim?" he said kindly.
"Yon is a scarlet coat right enough, lad,
but scarlet coats hunt men no longer over
the moors.  What make you of it, Davie?"
</p>

<p>
"No more than you, father," I replied,
proud that he had appealed to me.  The
crimson dot was motionless, and no farther
from the cliffs than we.  So, with a word
to Grim, we walked along more hastily, the
sheep clear forgot in this new interest.
Scarlet coats were uncommon in these
parts, and little liked.  As we drew
nearer we began to see that this could be
no man, as at first we had thought, nor
yet a woman.  Indeed, it seemed to be a
garment flung down all in a heap, and I
stared at it in vain.
</p>

<p>
Then the sun outburst all around us.
As it did so, the crimson thing yonder
seemed to be imbued with life, and my
father gave a cry of amazement.
</p>

<p>
"A lassie!  Now, where can she&mdash;"
</p>

<p class="capcenter">
<a id="img-008"></a>
<img class="imgcenter" src="images/img-008.jpg" alt="My father gave a cry of amazement." />
<br />
<i>My father gave a cry of amazement.</i>
</p>

<p>
Without finishing, he broke into a run,
and I followed excitedly, for the figure
was plainly that of a little girl.  But what
a girl!  She was no more than mine own
age, and the scarlet cloak fell from neck
to heels about her as she came to meet
us.  Over the cloak was streaming a mass
of yellow hair that seemed like spun gold
in the sunlight, and presently I slowed my
pace to stare at her.
</p>

<p>
Young though I was, I noted a peculiar
quality in her as she ran to meet my father
with outstretched hands, tears still upon
her cheeks.  I know not how to describe
this quality, save that it was one of
absolute faith and confidence, as if she had
been waiting there for us.  Old Grim hung
behind, seemingly in doubt, but my father
caught the lassie to him, which in itself
was quite enough to make me all the more
amazed.
</p>

<p>
"Why, the bairn's gey weet!" he cried
out in the Scots dialect he seldom or never
used.  And with that I came up to them,
and saw that in truth she was dripping
wet.  In reply to my father's words she
spoke to him, but not in English or Scots,
nor in any tongue that I had ever heard.
</p>

<p>
Bewildered and somewhat fearful, my
father addressed her in honest Gaelic, but
she only stared at him and me, her arms
cuddled around his beard and neck in
content.  Then, to my further surprise, she
laughed and broke out in French.
</p>

<p>
"You will take me home, gentlemen?
Have you seen my mother?"
</p>

<p>
By the words, I knew her for a lady,
and stammered out what she had said, to
my father.  He, poor man, was all for
looking at her bonny face and stroking her
hair, so I bespoke her in his place.
</p>

<p>
"Home?  And where have you come
from?  Where is your mother?"
</p>

<p>
At this her lips twisted apprehensively,
whereat my father cried out on me angrily;
but she came around right bravely and
made reply.
</p>

<p>
"We were going back to France, young
sir.  And my mother was in the boat."
</p>

<p>
"In the boat!" I repeated, the truth
coming upon me.  "Then how came you
here?"
</p>

<p>
"Why," she returned prettily, "it was
dark, and the big waves frightened poor
mother, and I fell in the water and got
all wet.  Then I climbed out and looked
for mother, but could not find her."
</p>

<p>
I put her words into Gaelic, staring the
while at her cloak-clasp, which was like
a seal of gold bearing a coat of arms.  But
when my father heard the story he drew
her to him with a half-sob.
</p>

<p>
"Davie, the lassie came ashore in the
storm!  Take Grim and run down to the
beach.  If you find any others, men or
women, bring them home.  And mind," he
flung over his shoulder savagely, "mind
you waste no time hunting for shells and
the like!"
</p>

<p>
He swung the little maid to his shoulder,
bidding Grim go with me, and so was striding
off across the moor before the words
were done.  I stared after the two of them,
and the lass waved a hand to me gayly
enough; but as I turned away I felt
something grip on my throat, for well I knew
what her story boded.  Many a good ship
has been blown north of the Irish coast
and full upon our cliffs, from the time of
the great Armada even to this day, and
few of them all have weathered the great
rocks that strew our coast from Bute to
Man.
</p>

<p>
There was little hope in my mind that I
would find anything left of that "boat"
the maid spoke of, but I called Grim and
started for the nearest gully leading down
to the shore.  Soon the rocks were towering
above me, and the beat of the surf
thundered ahead, and then I entered a little
sheltered cove where I had gathered shells
many a time.
</p>

<p>
Almost at my feet there was a boat&mdash;a
ship's longboat, rolling bottom side up
on the rocks.  I stood looking around, but
could see no living thing on the spray-wet
rocks that glittered black in the sunlight.
Then Grim gave a little growl and pawed
at something just below us.  I felt a thrill,
for more than once he had found in just
such fashion the body of a dead sailor, but
as I stooped down to the object rolling in
the foam I saw it was nothing but a helpless
crab washed up into a pocket.  I pulled
him out with a jerk and flung him back
into the waves, turning away.  The longboat
was not worth saving, being battered to
pieces, and if any of the crew had reached
the shore they were not in sight.
</p>

<p>
So Grim and I returned home across the
moor.  How had a French ship come so
far north, and on our western coasts too,
I wondered?  As we went, Grim found
a score of sheep clustered in a hollow,
so I hastened on and left him to drive
the poor brutes home.
</p>

<p>
When I reached the house I made
report of my errand, seeking some trace
of the maid.  But she was asleep in my
own cot, and her crimson cloak was drying
before the peat-fire, which seemed more
like to fill it with smoke than dryness.
</p>

<p>
"Did you find who she was or whence?"
I asked my mother, knowing that she spoke
the French tongue far better than I.
</p>

<p>
"The poor child knew naught," she
replied, as she mixed a bowl of broth and
set it to keep warm.  "The only name
she knows is Marie&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Which will be spoke no more in my
house," broke out my father with a black
frown.  "I doubt not the lassie's people
were rank Papists&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Shame on you, Fergus!" cried my
mother indignantly, facing him.  "When
a poor shipwrecked bairn comes and clings
her arms about your neck, you name her
Papist&mdash;shame on you!  Begone about your
business, and let sleeping dogs lie, Fergus
MacDonald.  Cameron and Claverhouse
are both forgot, and see to it&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
But my father had incontinently fled out
the door to get in the sheep, and my
mother laughed as she turned to me and
bade me give the red cloak a twist to
"clear the peat out of it."
</p>

<p>
Now, that was the manner of the coming
of the little maid.  Two days later
my father took me to Rathesby with him
to seek out her folk, if that might be.
But no tidings had been brought of any
wreck, and the best we might do was to
write&mdash;with much difficulty, for my father
was ever handier with staff than with
pen&mdash;a letter to Edinburgh, making a rude
copy of the arms on the gold buckle, and
seeking to know what family bore those
arms.  No reply ever came to this letter, and
whether it ever arrived we never knew.
</p>

<p>
And for this we were all content enough,
I think.  The lassie had twined herself
about my mother's heart by her winning
ways, and that confident, all-trusting
matter laid hold strongly upon my father's
heart, so that ere many weeks it was
decided that she should stay with us until
her folk should come to seek her.
</p>

<p>
I remember that there was some difficulty
over naming her, for my father
would have called her Ruth, which he
plucked at random from the Bible on the
hearth.  I think my mother was set on
calling her Mary, but the name of Mary
Stuart was hard in my father's memory,
and he would not.
</p>

<p>
So the weeks lengthened into months,
and the months into years, and ever Ruth
and I were as brother and sister in the
farmstead at Ayrby.  She learned English
readily enough, but the Gaelic tongue was
hard for her, which was great sorrow to
my father all his days.

CHAPTER II.
<br /><br />
GIB O' CLARCLACH.
</h3>

<p>
Seven of those years were the happiest
of all my life, perhaps.  Ruth and I
dwelt quiet at home, and between
whiles of the work my mother taught
us much that we had never known else.
She was of good family, of the Eastoun
Errols, and how she came to love my
father, who was rough and rude, was
always something of a mystery to me.  But
love him she did, and he her, and it was a
bad day for Fergus MacDonald when my
mother died.
</p>

<p>
This happening took place seven years
after the coming of Ruth, and was a sore
grief to all of us.  I never realized just
how sore a grief it was to my father,
Fergus, until later.  She was buried beside
those of the Covenant who had escaped
the harrying to die in peace, and I mind
me that it was on a cold, gray day which
gave us little cheer.
</p>

<p>
The elder, old Alec Gordon, had carried
pistol and sword at Ayrsmoss, being given
to preaching later in life.  His mind was
a bitter one, setting well with that of my
father, and this day of my mother's funeral
gave me a distaste for the men of the
Covenant that I never outgrew.  When it
was all over I crept away and went down
to the cliff-edge, where Ruth presently
joined me, and we sat along with the
heart-hunger that was eating at us until
the night-mists warned us home.
</p>

<p>
For many days thereafter my father
spoke few words, and of a sudden his age
had come upon him, together with a
strange unrest that I had not seen in him
before.  But still we abode there on the
old farm until I was almost nineteen, and
Ruth, as we guessed, a year younger.  Then
came the first of those strange happenings
that led us so far afield and drew us into
so weird a strand of Fortune's net before
we had done.
</p>

<p>
Two years after my mother's death, my
father began to have a succession of visitors.
There was much talk in those days of
the new lands over sea, and the rich farms
to be had there for the taking.  From
what scattered words that came to us, Ruth
and I judged rightly enough that these
folk were talking of the plantations to my
father, and so indeed it proved.  Alec
Gordon was the most constant visitor, and in
time it came out that he would make a
settlement in the new world, of a number
of our folk.  My father was much taken
with the scheme, as were Muckle Jock Grier
and Tam Graham, and others of the
families near by.  At length my father
announced that the next day but one Ruth
and I should go with him to Rathesby.
</p>

<p>
His temper was dour and sullen in these
days, and I dared not question him overmuch,
but Ruth got the truth of the matter
out of him on the way to town.  It seemed
that the elder, Alec Gordon, had prevailed
upon a dozen families to carry the Covenant
to the New World, and there to found a
settlement to the glory of God, where there
would be none to interfere or hinder, and
where, as my father put it, "a new folk
might be given growth by the Lord's grace,
free from the temptations of the world and
the wiles of the devil."  But there were
more devils in the New World than my
father or old Alec wotted of.
</p>

<p>
I think he was much moved to this end
by thought of Ruth and me, for he was
earnest that we should follow in his
footsteps and grow up God-fearing, respected
young folk such as Lang Robin Grier.
Now I ever was, and am still, I trust,
God-fearing; but sour faces were little to my
liking, and ranting Lang Robin much less.
I mind me that when Robin would have
impressed some doctrinal point upon Ruth,
with many wise sayings and much doubting
that her mind was sound in the faith,
I went home with sore knuckles, and Robin
went home with a sore face and a story
that wrought much discredit upon me.
Howbeit, to my tale.
</p>

<p>
We rode into Rathesby, where my father
was to see Wat Herries, the master of the
stout lugger that sailed to Ireland and
France and beyond, and that even then lay
in Rathesby bay.  Smaller vessels than the
"Lass o' Dee" had passed overseas in
safety, and my father trusted in the hand
of God more than he trusted in the hand
of Wat Herries.
</p>

<p>
It was still early morn when we reached
the port and put up our ponies at the
Purple Heather, kept by old Gib Lennox.  Then
my father told me to wander at my will,
taking good care of Ruth and returning at
midday, while he strode off in search of
Master Herries.  The "Lass," we found, was
newly come from France, and in her crew
were many dark-faced fellows whose tongue
sounded sweet in the ears of Ruth, so that
we had to stop more than once and listen.
</p>

<p>
In the front of her cloak, now a modest
gray one, she wore that same brooch with
which she had come to us.  I had hard
work to keep her from speaking to the
strange men in their own tongue, but after
a time we came to the edge of the town
and sat there among the rocks, well content
to watch the lugger in the harbor and the
fishing boats that lay around her.
</p>

<p>
As we sat there two men came strolling
by&mdash;two of the sailors whom we had
seen in the town.  One was ordinary
enough, the other a not ill-favored rogue
save for deep pock-marks on his face that
bespoke the plague, and a roving, cunning
eye that bespoke a shifty soul.  These
passed so close that their talk floated to
us, and naught would do Ruth but that I
must call them over so that she might
speak to them in French.  Whereat,
somewhat sullenly, I obeyed, and the men
strolled across the shingle to us.
</p>

<p>
"And what might you wish, pretty
maid?" asked the pock-marked fellow
civilly enough.
</p>

<p>
"I but wished to hear the French tongue,
sir," she replied with a smile.  "It is
long since I have spoken it&mdash;why, what is
the matter?"
</p>

<p>
For a sudden the man had given a little
start, his eyes fixed on her throat.  Then
he stared into her eyes, and at the look of
him I half gained my feet.
</p>

<p>
"Your name?" he asked quickly.  "What
is your name, little one?"
</p>

<p>
"What is that to you, fellow?" I made
hot answer, angry at his insolence.  But
Ruth caught my sleeve and pulled me down.
</p>

<p>
"Nay, Davie!  Why should he not know?
It were but civil to speak him fair, after
calling to him.  My name is Ruth, Ruth
MacDonald," she added in French.  At
this it seemed to me that the man stared
harder than ever, a puzzled look in his
face.
</p>

<p>
"And how come you to speak our
tongue?" he said, smiling quickly, so that
I lost my anger.  "It is strange to find
one on these coasts who speaks so well and
fluently!"
</p>

<p>
Ruth replied that she had had good
teachers, and after a few words more the
men walked on.  But I noted that the one
we had spoken with flung back more than
one glance, and I was glad when midday
came and we made our way back to the
inn to eat.
</p>

<p>
There we found my father in deep
converse with Master Herries, a hearty man
of some two-score years, and straightway
all thought of the two seamen fled my
mind.  For now the talk was all of lading
and cargo, of whether sheep might be
fetched in the lugger and of how many
persons might sail with her.  My father was
set on taking with us as many sheep as
might be, notwithstanding Wat Herries told
him there was little sheep-land in the plantations.
</p>

<p>
While we ate and listened, Alec Gordon
came in and brought a list of all those
who had covenanted to go on the "Lass."  The
price was then agreed on, and much
against my will my father bade me take
Ruth forth again for an hour or two, as
the inn was filling with seamen who drank
much and talked loud, and there was but
the one room.
</p>

<p>
So down to the sea we went once again,
having had our fill of the town-sights, and
wandered south along the low cliffs and the
shore.  Luckily enough, as it chanced, I
picked up a water-clean cudgel that lay
among the rocks and used it in sport as a
staff.  A bit after, I espied a small
cuttlefish washed into a pool, and swooped down
on the place in delight.  But Ruth, who
cared little for such creations as had snaky
arms and hideous aspect, rambled onward
among the rocks.
</p>

<p>
I was much concerned with my find, and
had great sport.  Once the foot-long arms
were wound around that stick of mine, the
creature would not let go, even though I
beat him gently against the rock.  I had no
mind to lose the cudgel by leaving it there,
and neither had I cruelty enough to crush
out the life of the ugly creature, so I
stayed and fought gently with him and
forgot the passage of time.
</p>

<p>
On a sudden came a faint cry to my
ears and I heard my name as if called
from far away.  Looking up, I saw no one
and remembered that Ruth had gone on
alone.  Thinking that she had fallen into
some pool among the rocks, mayhap, I
caught up the stick, cuttlefish and all, and
ran to the point of rocks that hid the
farther shore from me.  And there I gave
a great cry of anger and amazement.
</p>

<p>
For, a quarter of a mile distant, I saw
Ruth being carried up the cliff by two
men.  Though I could not see them well,
for they were in the cliff-shadow, I
remembered the two seamen instantly.
Without pausing to think, I ran swiftly back
to a little path that led up the cliff, in
white anger.  I knew these parts well, and
when I gained the crest I would be betwixt
the three and the town.
</p>

<p>
In this thought I was right, for in my
haste I had beat them to the cliff-top and
was running toward them when they
appeared.  Plainly they had not counted on
me, because as I appeared they seemed no
little alarmed.  Then when I drew near,
there came a flash of steel in the
sunlight and my heart stood still, lest they
injure Ruth.
</p>

<p>
But whatever their intention, it was
unfulfilled.  Before I could get to them Ruth
began to struggle, and broke away just
as the knives gleamed.  One of the rogues
wanted to run, but the other called to him
to stay steady and regain the maid when
they had flung the boy over the cliff.  This
did not serve to calm me over-much, and
I must have clean forgot to fear their
knives.
</p>

<p>
As I ran up, the one of them sprang,
but I whirled around the cudgel, which
the cuttlefish yet clung to.  The swing of
it flung him off, and while I was still a
few paces from the seaman I saw the creature
strike him full in the face, as though
thrown from a hand-sling&mdash;though it was
the sheerest good fortune.  With a great
shriek the man turned and made off, clutching
at his face, and I saw no more of him
after.
</p>

<p>
But with the second man, him of the
pock-marks, I was right soon busied.
Amazed as he was at the somewhat
ludicrous fate of his fellow, he came at me
evilly.  With a quick motion I shortened
the cudgel and stabbed him in the breast
with it, the point of his knife just
shearing through my shirt, but harming me not
at all.  Then I gripped him by the neck
and wrist.
</p>

<p>
Now we MacDonalds have ever been
accounted strong men, and although scant
nineteen, my father was wont to say that I
promised not to disgrace the family in my
strength.  That was no light praise from
his lips, but I never knew the worth of it
till I gripped that seaman in my two hands.
The anger that was upon me for the sake
of Ruth was so great that there seemed to
be a red haze in my eyes, and then I
realized that the man had dropped his knife
and was all but limp.  Whereat I lifted him
up and threw him to the heather, where he
lay quiet.
</p>

<p>
Then I knew that Ruth was hanging to
my arm, pleading with me not to harm the
man.  I stared down at her, breathing
heavily, and wondered what to do with him.
</p>

<p>
"Were you hurt, lassie?" I asked in haste.
</p>

<p>
"No, Davie.  They came upon me
suddenly, and I had but time to cry to you
before they clapped a kerchief to my mouth
and lifted me.  At the top of the cliff I
broke from them.  But&mdash;oh, I fear me you
have hurt this man sore!"
</p>

<p>
"And well enough for him," I responded
grimly.  "He is like to be worse hurt when
my father lays hands on him."
</p>

<p>
"David!  Surely they are punished
enough!" she cried out.  Looking down
at her, I saw that her golden hair was
streaming free and in her face was that
same all-trusting look wherewith she had
met us nine years before.  The memory of
that day struck me like a shock, so that I
stared speechless.  Just then the sailor
groaned, rolled over, and sat up.  I put my
foot on his knife, debating whether to hale
him to Rathesby or not.
</p>

<p>
"Let him go, David," pleaded Ruth.
"Truly, they did me no harm, and if father
knew of it he would be very angry.  Do
not tell him, Davie, for it can do no good
and will only make him dour for days."
</p>

<p>
Now this was true enough, and when the
flame of my wrath had quieted somewhat I
was not over-anxious to kindle the flame
again in my father's heart.  So I looked
down at the man and bade him stand up,
which he did with a groan, rubbing his
neck.
</p>

<p>
"Who are you," I asked sternly.  "What
was your intent?"
</p>

<p>
He glanced from me to Ruth, an odd
gleam in his crafty eyes which liked me
little.  He seemed to hesitate before
answering, though I had spoken in his own
tongue.
</p>

<p>
"I am called Gib o' Clarclach," he
replied surlily, in right good Gaelic.  As I
stared in amazement, he darted a venomous
look at me.  "But elsewhere I am known
as The Pike," he added, "and I have
friends you wot not of, stripling.  So best
say no more of this."
</p>

<p>
"That for you and your friends," and
I snapped my fingers.  "What wanted you
with this maid?  Answer, or you lie in
Rathesby gaol this night."
</p>

<p>
But all the answer I got was a mocking
laugh, as the fellow sprang away and was
gone down the cliff-path. I plunged
forward, but Ruth's hand clutched mine and
her voice pulled me back. "Nay, Davie!
Leave him go and let us return&mdash;for&mdash;for
I am afraid!"
</p>

<p>
And the little sob she gave held me to
her more than her grip, so that I laid her
head against my shoulder and comforted
her until she smiled once more. But she
did not smile until I had promised to say
no word of the affair to my father Fergus.

<h3>
CHAPTER III.
<br /><br />
THE "LASS O' DEE" SAILS.
</h3>

<p>
We talked little on the way back to
the town, but none the less I was
wondering greatly.  So this seeming
Frenchman could talk good Gaelic
speech, as well as chatter French!  That
set me to marveling, for he looked like
a Frenchman right enough.  And what he
called himself&mdash;The Pike!  Surely that
was no name for an honest man to bear,
considering what kind of fish the pike was,
even had the very giving of such a name
not been a heathenish and outlandish thing.
I had heard that the heathen in the colonies
were named after beasts and birds, and
so I came to the conclusion that he must
have lived overseas.  His Gaelic, however,
was not that of the west coast, but held
the burn of the Highlands.
</p>

<p>
I kept all this thinking to myself for the
next few days.  No harm had been done
Ruth, so no harm had come of it; though
why they dared to carry off a Scots maiden
so near home was more than I could
explain.  In the end I gave up the attempt,
having other things to busy myself with.
</p>

<p>
When we had reached the inn once more
we found my father ready to depart.  With
him was sour old Alec Gordon, who would
bide with us at Ayrby over night.  They
rode on ahead, and from their talking Ruth
and I gained some inkling of the great
scheme.
</p>

<p>
The "Lass" had been engaged to take
over the expedition upon her return from
the next cruise, which would be in a
month's time.  This would give us who
were going plenty of time to sell our farms
and stock and to make all ready for
departure.  As to selling these, there would
be little trouble about that, for the hill
folk and those from the south would be
glad enough to take them over and pay
ready cash.  We of the west have alway
been accounted poor folk, but even in those
days it was a poor farm indeed that did not
have a leathern sack hidden away beneath
the hearth, with something therein to clink.
The days of Claverhouse had taught the
west folk a stern lesson.
</p>

<p>
Neither Ruth nor I was greatly in favor
of seeking the New World.  We had many
a conversation about Gib o' Clarclach,
which usually resolved itself into
wondering why he had stared so at the golden
brooch; and in the end Ruth placed it
away and wore it no more until our
departure.  She loved our home, with its
rolling moors and cliffs and mountains, and
could see no reason for change; for that
matter, neither could my father, except
that, as I said before, he was restless and
thinking about our future state.
</p>

<p>
As for me, I was wild to stay.  Most
lads would have wanted to cross the world,
but not I, for there was great talk
of the Stuart in the air.  My father, who
held all Stuarts for Papists, was bitter
strong for Orange and the Dutch, but the
romance of Prince Charles was eager in
me.  There were constant rumors that the
French fleet was coming, that men were
arming in the Highlands, and that the
clans and the men of the Isles were up,
but nothing came of it all and our
preparations went steadily forward.
</p>

<p>
It was no light task in those days to go
into the New World and found a settlement
there.  We were to take a dozen
sheep, and my father refused to part with
Grim, of course.  All the rest was to be
handed over to my father's kinsman, Ian
MacDonald, together with the stead itself.
Our personal possessions were all packed
stoutly in three great chests of oak bound
with iron, and into one of these went
Ruth's little red cloak, that my mother had
kept always.
</p>

<p>
Those were sad days for us, were the
days of parting.  There was ever something
of the woman in my boy nature, I
think, for it grieved me sore to part with
the things I had known all my life, but
especially to turn over to strangers the
things about the house that my mother had
loved and used.  There was a big crock, I
remember, which she had used for making
the porridge every morning, and Ruth after
her; this my father would not let us pack,
saying that broken pots would make poor
porridge in the colonies.
</p>

<p>
"Then it shall make porridge no more,"
I replied hotly, and caught up the heavy
crock.  Ruth gave a little cry as it
shattered on the hearthstone, and I looked to
feel my father's staff.  But instead, he only
gazed across the room and nodded to himself.
</p>

<p>
"Let be, Davie lad.  We cannot always
dash our crocks upon the stones and start
anew.  Now fetch in some peat ere the
fire dies."
</p>

<p>
Very humbly, and a good bit ashamed,
I obeyed.  I had not thought there was so
much restraint in my father, of late.
</p>

<p>
To tell the honest truth, Fergus MacDonald,
as the neighbors said, was "fey"
ever since the death of my mother.  He
would take his staff and Grim and so stride
across the moors, return home in the
evening, and speak no word for hours.
These moods had been growing on him,
but the bustle and stir of our preparations
seemed to wake him out of himself in
some degree, for which I was duly
thankful.
</p>

<p>
The day of sailing had been set for the
end of May, in the year 1710.  Alec
Gordon rode over with the word that the
"Lass" had returned and her cargo&mdash;which
as all knew, was contraband&mdash;had
been safely "run" farther down the coast.
The Griers were already in Rathesby, with
two or three other families, and old Alec
was gathering his flock together for the
voyage.
</p>

<p>
So early the next morning we shut up
the stead for Ian to take charge when
he would, and departed for ever, as it
seemed.  We rode but slowly, Grim driving
the sheep steadily before him and us,
until we came to a roll of the moor we
paused for a last look at the old place.
As we turned away I caught a sparkle on
my father's gray beard and the sight put
a sudden sob in my throat; as for Ruth,
she made no secret of her tears.  And
thus we left the little gray house behind
us and rode with out faces toward the west
and the sound of the sea beating on our
ears.
</p>

<p>
We came down to Rathesby at last and
found the little port in wild confusion.
In all, there were eight families
leaving&mdash;the Griers, two Grahams, three of the
Gordons, Auld Lag Hamilton and his sons,
and our own little party from Ayrby.  All
that afternoon we were busy getting the
sheep stowed away on board&mdash;which Wat
Herries considered sheer foolishness, as I
did myself&mdash;and for that night we put up
at the Purple Heather, the women
sleeping in the guest-rooms while we men
rolled up in our plaids and lay in the
great room down below.
</p>

<p>
There was much talking that night ere
the rushlights were blown out, and I
learned that our destination was to be the
colony taken from the Dutch long before
and renamed New York, where land might
be had for the taking.  Indeed, I learned
for the first time that Alec Gordon had
not gone into this venture blindly, but had
procured letters to the folk there from
others of the faith in Holland, so that we
were sure of a goodly welcome.
</p>

<p>
There was one matter that troubled me
greatly that night, and kept sleep from
me for a long time.  This was that while
we were loading sheep aboard that day I
had seen a face among Master Herries'
crew, and it was the face of Gib o'
Clarclach, as he called himself.  I wondered at
his daring to return in the "Lass,"
knowing her loading and her errand, and for
a moment I was tempted to have a word
with Herries himself on the matter.
Howbeit, I decided against it and thereupon
fell off to sleep, concluding that the man
had sufficient punishment already and that
to pursue him for a past fault would be
no worthy end.  But in days to come I
repented me much of this, as you shall see.
</p>

<p>
In the morning we made a hasty breakfast
together, and assembled in the big
room for a last prayer.  It was like to
be morning-long, and after taking due part
for an hour I slipped quietly through the
door; not out of disrespect, but out of
sheer weariness, for Alec Gordon was
famed for his long-windedness.  Master
Herries and his men were waiting aboard
the "Lass," but as I watched the ship
from the bench outside the inn, I was
aware of a man calling my name and
pointing.
</p>

<p>
Turning, I saw that he was directing me
to the hillsides, and there in the gleam
of the sunlight I saw a dozen men riding
breakneck toward the port.
</p>

<p>
"Best get auld Alec out," suggested the
fisherman, and the look of him told me
there was more afoot than I knew.  So,
taking my courage in hand, I slipped in
through the side door again and so up
behind the elder, in the shadow of the big
settle.  Waiting till he had finished a
drawn-out phrase, I leaned toward his ear.
</p>

<p>
"Alec Gordon, there be men riding hard
down the moors."
</p>

<p>
It seemed to me that his face changed
quickly, but not his voice, for he continued
quietly enough.
</p>

<p>
"Tam Graham, lead your flock to the
boats.  Do you follow him, Fergus, and
all of you make what haste is possible."  With
that he fell into the border tongue as
they all looked up in amazement.  "Scramble
oot, freends!" he cried hastily.  "The
kye are in the corn!"
</p>

<p>
Now well enough I knew that for the
old alarm-cry of the men of Cameron, nor
was I the only one.  There was a single
deep murmur, and the Grahams poured
forth into the street.  After them came
the rest of us, I falling in at Ruth's side
behind my father, and we hastened down
to the boats.  I failed utterly to see what
danger there could be, and cast back an
eye at the riders.  They were still a
quarter-mile away, but coming on furiously.
</p>

<p>
In less time than it takes to tell, we
were into the small boats and rowing out
to the ship.  As I scrambled up the side
I could hear the clatter of hoofs on the
cobbles, but above us there was a creak of
ropes and a flutter of canvas.  Then there
came shouts from shore, but we could not
hear the words and paid no heed.
</p>

<p>
"Hasten!" shouted Master Herries,
roaring like a bull at the men, and we
saw a boat pulling out from shore.  It
reached us just as our anchor lifted,
and over the rail scrambled a stout man
waving a parchment with dangling seals.
</p>

<p>
"Halt, in the Royal name!" he squeaked,
and my father stepped out to him.
</p>

<p>
"What's a' the steer aboot?" asked my
father quietly.  At this I looked for
trouble, for it was in my mind that whenever
Fergus MacDonald had come to using the
Scots dialect, there had been doings
afterward.
</p>

<p>
"Ha' ye permission to gan awa' frae
Scotland?" cried the stout man, puffing and
blowing as he glared around.  "Well ye
ken ye hae nane, Fergus MacDonald, an'
since I hae coom in siccan a de'il's hurry&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Be off," broke in my father sternly,
pointing to the shore.  For answer the
fellow waved out his parchment spluttering
something about the "Royal commeesioner"
that I did not fully catch.  But
my father caught it well enough, and his
face went black as he strode forward and
lifted the stout man in both hands, easily.
</p>

<p>
"Say to him it wad fit him better to look
to his ain life than ours," he roared, and
therewith heaved up the man and sent him
overside into the bay.  Wat Herries cried
out sharply to duck behind the bulwarks
lest shot be flying, but there was none of
that.  I saw the stout man picked up by
his boat and return to shore, shaking his fist
vainly at the laughter which met and
followed him; then the wind bellied out our
sails and the voyage was begun.  A little
later it came out that news had spread
abroad of our purpose and that the
commissioner had wished to stop us, but for
what reason I never knew.
</p>

<p>
My father conjectured shrewdly enough
that we would have been sent elsewhere
than to New York.  However, we soon
forgot that, for the whole party was
clustered on the poop watching the purple hills
behind us.  The little port faded ere long
into a solid background, for the breeze was
a stiff one, and that afternoon we looked
our last on Scotland.  This was the
occasion for another address and prayer from
Alec Gordon, and this time I joined in right
willingly.  I had never been so far from
land before, and the tossing of the ship
made me no wee bit uneasy.
</p>

<p>
Nor was this lessened during the following
days.  Five in all I suffered, together
with all the moor-folk, as I never want to
suffer more.  Ruth was free from the
sickness, as was my father, but Maisie Graham,
poor soul, came near dying with it.  After
the fifth day, however, I crawled out on
deck a new man, albeit weak in the legs,
and never knew that the sun could feel so
good.
</p>

<p>
The next day thereafter I was almost
myself again, and paid back the jests of
Ruth with interest.  She had great sport
of my sickness, although to tell the truth
she tended me with unremitting care and
kindness, when my father would have let
me be to get over it as best I could.
</p>

<p>
To confess it straightway, I gained
greater respect for Alec Gordon in those
days, and in those to come, than I had ever
felt before.  The sight of the great ocean
around us and the feel of the tossing deck
that alone kept us from harm, put the fear
of God into my heart in good surety, so
that I entered into the morning and evening
meetings with new earnestness.  Nor was
it only while the danger lasted that I felt
thus.  I had seen the ocean full often, but
I had never so much as gone out with a
fishing-boat, and those first few days were
full of grim earnestness that proved their
worth in the end.
</p>

<p>
It was on the twelfth day out that the
first untoward event happened, for one of
the seamen cried down to us that he had
sighted a small boat that was all but
sinking.  Sure enough, we on deck could descry
a point of white ahead, and all of us
gathered in eagerness as we drew up to
her.  Thus far we had had good weather,
and by now even Maisie Graham was free
of the sickness.
</p>

<p>
As we came closer to the little boat,
which was no larger than a sloop, we saw
that she held only one man.  Then a sense
of strangeness seemed to settle over us
when we knew that this one man was old,
his long white hair and beard flying in the
wind, but he stood erect and tall at his
tiller.  The strangest thing of all was that
his cranky old craft was headed west, into
the ocean itself, instead of back toward the
land.
</p>

<br />
<i>As we came closer to the little boat <br />
we saw that she held only one man.</i>
</p>

<p>
At our hail he came about readily
enough, for his boat seemed much battered
and was half full of sea-water.  Handling
her with no little skill, he laid us aboard
and sprang over the rail.  As he did so, I
heard some of the seamen muttering in
Gaelic&mdash;something about one of the
sea-wizards; but to this I gave little heed as
we all hastened to surround the old man
and to talk with him.

<h3>
CHAPTER IV.
<br /><br />
THE MAN FROM THE SEA.
</h3>

<p>
A fine-looking man he was, too,
despite his age.  I put him down as
three-score and ten, and found later
that I had not been far wrong.  His face
was hard-set and stern, like that of some
eagle, his nose finely curved, and his
deep-set eyes&mdash;ah, what eyes those were!  Never
since have I seen eyes like his.  They
seemed to be gazing far off, even as they
looked into one's own; they seemed to see
some great vision not given to other men's
sight, as in truth I believe they did.
</p>

<p>
His hair was snow-white, but very thick,
hanging about his shoulders, and on his
bronzed neck was tattooed some strange
animal which I had never before seen.  So
we stood about him, staring, while Wat
Herries cast off the little sloop and left
her to sink as she would.
</p>

<p>
The stranger searched us with those
great black eagle-eyes, but shook his head
at Alec Gordon's Gaelic, and muttered
something that fetched a joyful cry from
Ruth, for it was in the French tongue.
</p>

<p>
"You are a Frenchman?" she inquired
quickly, pushing to my side.  The stranger
glanced at us, then his great figure
quivered as a tree shakes beneath the ax.  I
could have sworn that a tinge of red
leaped into his pale cheeks and that he was
gazing at the golden brooch which once
more held Ruth's cloak, but he replied
slowly and calmly in a musical voice:
</p>

<p>
"I speak French, mademoiselle, though
I may not claim to belong to that nation."
</p>

<p>
"Who are you?" asked Ruth, "and what
are you doing in that little boat?"
</p>

<p>
"As to my name, that matters not," he
replied with a bow that could only have
been learned in courts.  "I was sailing to
the west, and if I might thank your
company for saving me from a leaky and all
but disabled craft, I would fain do so
through you."
</p>

<p>
Ruth put his words into our own tongue,
somewhat disconcerted at his courteous
aloofness, whereat Alec Gordon rubbed his
chin, and bade us salute him courteously.
</p>

<p>
"Tell the man that he must e'en go to
the colonies with us," he said, knitting
his gray eyebrows.  "If he will not tell
his name, we care little.  Ask him of his
religion."
</p>

<p>
And so Ruth did.  But at the question
the old man straightened up and a flash
of fire leaped into his wondrous eyes.
</p>

<p>
"Who are you that dare to question
me?" he replied sternly and proudly.  "As
to my religion, that is my own affair.
May I ask your name, mistress?"
</p>

<p>
"We are of Scotland, of the Covenant,"
she returned simply, giving her name.  He
frowned as if in perplexity.  "Fear not,"
smiled the little maid, mistaking his
attitude.  "You are with friends, old man,
and if you be not a Papist your religion
matters not."
</p>

<p>
He laughed shortly, staring down upon
her.  "Not I, maiden.  As to fear, I am
more hungered than fearful, though I have
felt fear often in my time."
</p>

<p>
As Ruth gave his words to the others
and my father led him to the cabin, I
turned over this speech in my mind and set
him down, boylike, as a coward.  Therein
I made a grave mistake, as I found out
ere long.
</p>

<p>
It was but natural that the stranger
should make great talk among us all, and
when he returned on deck, his tall figure
wrapped in a spare plaid of Tam Graham's,
we gazed at him ever more eagerly.  But
he gave us little heed, going forward into
the bow and sitting there upon a coil of
rope, gazing out into the west as if the
ship sped not fast enough for him.  After
a little, Ruth and I, being the only ones
aboard who could speak French, save the
sailors, came to him.  He did not repel
us&mdash;nay, there was something about the man
that drew us both, and Ruth more than me;
he seemed like one who had seen many
strange things, and the secret that shone
forth from his deep eyes half frightened
while it attracted me.  As for Ruth, she
felt sorry for him in his loneliness and
wished to talk her French also, for she
ever held that my accent was most vile.
</p>

<p>
He gave us a kindlier welcome than I
had looked for, and when he smiled all his
sternness vanished and I knew on the
instant that here was a man who had
suffered and loved greatly, and who knew
how to win love from other men.  There
was about him something of that same
quality which Ruth so greatly possessed,
the quality of drawing out the faith of
others, of quiet trust and confidence.  I was
not to know for many long weeks what it
really meant to love and be loved by him,
but, as I perched on the anchor chains and
stared frankly at him, I thought that it
must indeed be hard to tell this man a lie.
</p>

<p>
"If you would speak English," he smiled
in the southland speech, "I can converse
well in that."
</p>

<p>
"Nay," and Ruth's laugh rippled out,
"French is mine own mother-tongue, and
seldom do I get a chance to use it."
</p>

<p>
"Are you French, then?  With your
name?" he asked quickly.  Now, though I
knew full well that Ruth had come there
with no such thought, she poured out the
tale of her coming to us over the moors,
as she had heard it often from my mother
and me.  This surprised me all the more
because as a rule she made light of it and
claimed Ayrby for home, and my people for
her people.
</p>

<p>
The old stranger listened to all her
story, but he remained silent and fell to
staring over the bowsprit again as if he
had not heard.  But I who watched him
saw him try to speak, as it were, then stop
suddenly and gulp in his throat.
</p>

<p>
"It is a strange tale," he replied after
a little, "and I thank you for the telling,
maiden.  Know you whither we are
bound?"
</p>

<p>
"For the New York colony," I replied,
somewhat downcast that he had not trusted
us in turn with his own tale.  He must
have read the thought in my eyes, for he
smiled sadly and I felt emboldened to
question him.  "What is that mark on
your throat?" I continued, gazing at the
tattooed animal.  "Is that some strange
beast?"
</p>

<p>
"Aye, strange enough," he turned human
all at once and laughed in my face
like a boy.  "It is a beaver, an animal of
the New World and of the old, yet stranger
never lived.  You will see many a
beaver-skin&mdash;aye, and sell them, too, perchance!"
</p>

<p>
"Then you have been in the New
World!" cried out Ruth, settling down
snugly at his side.  "Tell us all about it,
sir!"
</p>

<p>
"The tale would outlast the voyage," he
said, looking down at her face.  A sudden
mad thought came into my mind, and before
I thought to stay it, sprang to my
lips.
</p>

<p>
"In the New World," I asked eagerly,
"did you ever know a man who was called
The Pike?"
</p>

<p>
The answer to that question was wonderful
enough.  With one quick motion he
leaned forward and gripped my shoulder
in a hand of iron; and when his eyes bored
into mine own I all but cried out, so like
pure flame was the look therein.
</p>

<p>
"What know you of him?" he asked
bitingly, and his tone minded me of my
father's when he had flung the Commissioner's
man over the rail.  In that instant
I feared this old stranger as never in my
life had I feared anyone, no, not even my
father; and so I gave him all I knew of
Gib o' Clarclach, without let or hindrance.
While I spoke, his grip loosened, but his
shaggy brows came down until they met.
</p>

<p>
"Lad," he said when I had made an
end, "keep this maid from that man as if
he were the plague itself!  Let him not
touch her, should you ever meet again, and
if he so much as looks at her put your
knife into him as into a dog gone mad!"
</p>

<p>
"Why, the fellow is aboard now," I
answered in wonder, and in no little fear.
But to my surprise the old man only turned
and gazed out into the sunset once more,
checking Ruth when she would have
spoken.
</p>

<p>
"My children," he said very softly,
"while I am here you are safe from this
man, remember that.  Nay, I would not
harm him.  I am an old man, but I have
been where no other white man has been;
I have been a ruler among men whose skins
are not as ours, and I go even now to end
my days among these people.  He, also, has
been among them, and I know not what
evil he is about here; but it seems to me
that the hand of God has drawn me to you
and to this ship, lest you come to harm.
Now leave me, my children, and count me
ever as a friend of the best."
</p>

<p>
Hand in hand, like two frighted
bairns, we left him and went aft in awe.
When we were alone in the cabin, all
the other folk being above, Ruth looked
strangely at me and caught my hand.
</p>

<p>
"Davie, is he not a wonderful man?  Do
you like him?"
</p>

<p>
"I fear him," I replied honestly.  "But
I think I could even love him, an' I had
the chance.  He is some great man, Ruth,
that I know!"
</p>

<p>
"I like him, too, and I am not a bit
feared of him," she said earnestly.  "Say
naught to anyone of what he said, Davie,
for I think he would trust us more than
others."
</p>

<p>
Whereto I agreed willingly enough,
remembering that shoulder-grip which still
burned me.  But that did not save me from
much speculating to myself.  First, why
had the old man been sailing westward in
a small and battered sloop, scarce fit for
coast fishing?  Second, what did he know
of Gib o' Clarclach?  And last and
greatest&mdash;  who was he?  These questions drove
through my mind as I went back to the
deck, but it was long ere any of them
were answered.  All that evening I looked
about for the face of Gib the sailor, but
saw it not.
</p>

<p>
Oddly enough, that same night a terrific
gale from the south came on us.  Odd,
because until then the weather had been
perfect, and also because of what followed.  It
was such a gale as I had never known
before, keeping up day after day and driving
us ever west and north, for the poor little
"Lass" could only run with a single shred
of sail to keep her right end forward.
</p>

<p>
That was a hard time for all of us.
Morn and eve we held assembly in the
larger of the cabins, where we men slept,
and Alec Gordon led us in prayer.  At
each of these meetings the old stranger
attended, although he took no part himself,
which my father liked but ill.  During
those days we younger men helped the
crew pull and haul, but the others were
cooped up in the cabin&mdash;and a dreary place
it was.  Alec and the rest kept up an
ever-lasting argument on Effectual Calling and
Reason Annexed, together with other such
topics as the articles of faith afforded, and
I was glad enough to be sharing with the
crew instead of listening to such talk
below, for I was ever fonder of action than
discussion.
</p>

<p>
I had nearly forgot the other part of our
crew and cargo&mdash;Grim, who kept company
with half a dozen more sheep dogs, and the
poor beasts stowed away in hasty-built
pens below.  The day the old stranger came
aboard, three of the sheep died, and what
with broken legs from the rolling of the
"Lass," and from sickness, the rest
followed speedily.  Wherein Wat Herries was
proved to know his business better than
my father.  As for Grim, he kept close
below after the storm began, and remained
there in safety, keeping near to my father's
heels as usual.
</p>

<p>
For a week that storm blew down on
us, and there was rest or comfort for none
aboard.  On the seventh day we had clear
weather once more and returned to our
course, from which we had been sadly
driven.  Two days after this befell a sore
accident, for Master Herries was knocked
down by a lower yard breaking from its
cordage, and when we picked him up his
right leg was found broken below the knee.
</p>

<p>
We carried him to his cabin and there
my father, who had no little leechcraft,
tended him.  This placed the ship in the
hands of an Ireland man called Black
Michael, who was good enough in his way,
but a poor mate, for as events proved he
had little hold on the men forward.
</p>

<p>
As if this were not enough, the storm
came back upon us the next day and again
the poor "Lass" fled helpless before it.
It was now that first I noted a peculiar
manner among the men, who like all our
west coast seamen were highly superstitious.
I thought little of it, nor dreamt
how it tended, until one night when I crept
forward to steal a pannikin of water from
the butt for Grim.  On my way back I
heard two seamen talking in Gaelic, behind
a corner of the cabins, and the wind
carried me their words.
</p>

<p>
"<i>Duar na Criosd!</i>" muttered one, an
Irisher like the mate.  "There is no doubt
of it, Eoghan!  I have seen it before, and
I tell you that unless Ruadh has green stuff
in plenty, he will die!  It is the scurvy, and
we have naught aboard to fight it with."
</p>

<p>
"Scurvy an' you like," replied the other
sullenly, "but I say it is the old wizard
whom we took aboard.  Do you mind the
tale of Jonah in the Scriptures?  Do you
mind how the sheep began to die when he
came, and how he brought the gale with
him?"
</p>

<p>
There was a little silence, and I felt my
heart sound against my ribs as I began
to comprehend their words.
</p>

<p>
"Like enough," answered the first with
an oath.  "But the scurvy is upon us, and
we be all dead men, Eoghan, unless we
fetch land right soon.  Nor is the manner of
that rotting death pleasant, and with this
he described the workings of scurvy until
my flesh creeped.
</p>

<p>
"Then let us have this Jonah overboard,"
cried out the other man on a sudden, and
despair was in his voice.  "Gib o' Clarclach
is with us, and the rest.  Black Michael
matters not; put this wizard overside and
we will have fair weather again.  Who
ever heard tell of such gales at this
season?"
</p>

<p>
Which same was true enough, and I
even wondered a trifle if the man might
not be right.
</p>

<p>
"Stay," returned the first.  "I have
a better plan.  The old wizard sleeps in
the cabin aft, with the captain.  I will
slip in there this very night, when the
watch is changed, and have my knife in
him and out again.  Let the elder lay it to
the Lord's vengeance an' he will, being
overfond of such talk."
</p>

<p>
At this the other man laughed shortly,
but I crept very silently across the heaving
deck to the cabin, and there was great
fear in my heart for all of us.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER V.
<br /><br />
HOW THE "LASS" WAS DRIFTED.
</h3>

<p>
On hands and knees, the deck beneath
me groaning and pitching to the
tossing of the great waves, and the
howling wind still seeming to thrill those
muttered words to me, I crawled on and
with some difficulty brought the water to
Grim, who thanked me in his own way.
Then I rose and looked about.
</p>

<p>
Around the table were lashed my father,
Alec Gordon, and Robin Grier, all arguing
at the top of their tongues.  In the bunks
lay the others, or on heaps of padded
canvas along the floor.  Then I understood
that the old stranger had gone to Master
Herries' cabin, where the mate sometimes
lay also, and was caring for the injured
man.  Besides Grim there were five other
dogs lying around, but the womenfolk
were all safe asleep in their own place.
</p>

<p>
I misliked saying anything to my father
and old Alec, for fear they would
disbelieve me.  Had Ruth been there I would
have sought counsel from her, and have
gained it, too; but a notion came to me
that the work might be done without a
quarrel.  Had I told my father the tale,
he might have sought out the two men and
cracked their heads together, likely
getting a knife in him for it.  So, without
disturbing any of the three at the table,
I caught hold on Grim and drew him out
of the cabin.
</p>

<p>
The master's cabin, where were the old
man and Wat, was but a miserable hole
to one side of our main room, and had
indeed been intended for some other use.
It would be easy enough for a man to slip
in and out again, I considered as I crossed
the few feet of open deck to get to it, Grim
holding back stiff-legged, in wild fear with
each toss of the lugger.  Then I cast open
the door of the little place and went in,
flinging Grim before me.
</p>

<p>
A roll of the ship assisted me in this,
so that Grim and I went in together and
fetched up against the old stranger, clean
taking him off his legs.  A ship's lanthorn
swung above, and by its light the old man
made out who we were, as we all rolled in
the corner in a heap.  For that matter,
he had long since proved a better sailor
than any of us on board, and now he was
on his feet instantly, and soon had me up.
</p>

<p>
There was little room for others when
the door was shut, and I saw that the old
man had been lying in the mate's bunk
when we came.  Above this lay Master
Herries, asleep in his own bunk despite
all the uproar.  Now, it had been in my
mind to set Grim awatch, but when the
old man smiled on me and asked my
errand, I had blurted out the whole
before I thought.  At the story he threw
back his head and laughed heartily,
seeming to take it as a huge joke.
</p>

<p>
"Nay, lad, be not put out," he cried
kindly, seeing that his laughter made me
angry, and therewith clapped me on the
shoulder.  "I laughed not at you, but at
them.  Why, it is a rare jest indeed, their
taking me for a wizard and thinking me
overside&mdash;belike it is the work of our
friend, Gib, too.  Bide you here, David,
and methinks we will carry out that jest
somewhat."
</p>

<p>
Pushing me and Grim into the corner,
he reached up and blew out the lanthorn,
then caught my hand in his and reached
for Grim's head as we all settled down
together.  I had begun to feel fear of him,
but when Grim suffered his petting I took
heart and cast it off.  Grim was a good
judge of men, and allowed few to handle
him as did this old stranger.
</p>

<p>
"This is not unlike a night I once spent
in the Canadas," broke out the rich,
musical voice of the old man.  "It was deep
winter, and I lay in a little cave with two
of my red brothers, after escaping from a
great town of the Ottawa nation.  For
you must know, lad, there are many races
of these red men, each at war with the
other."
</p>

<p>
"I know little about it, sir," I answered.
</p>

<p>
Methought he gave a little impatient sigh
at that.  "Lord, will these thick-headed
English never learn where lies their
greatest rulership?  But no matter.  My own
people, among whom I was a chief, were
named Mohawks, and we had been
captured by the Ottawas after a great raid
out to the westward.  All of us were sore
wounded and far from home, having no
meat save two rabbits we caught, all
during the two weeks we lay there.
</p>

<p>
"Well, on this night of which I speak
we were all but frozen, and at length made
shift to build a small fire.  All around us
were our enemies, and we had seen a dozen
braves searching that same day.  It was
something like midnight when I, who was
on watch, saw a tall deer pass&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
And more of that story I never heard,
because just at that instant the door of
the cabin opened very softly, and I almost
thought it had been done by a lurch of
the ship but for feeling Grim bristle.  Then
my hair stood on end with pure horror,
for in the cabin above the timber-groan and
howl of the wind, there came three shrill,
clear hoots of an owl.
</p>

<p>
A dark shape which had filled the doorway
suddenly paused.  Grim began a growl,
but I checked him at hearing a chuckle
from the old man, and berated myself for a
fool.  It was his work, of course.  But
there in the dark it sounded eerie enough,
and when two raven-calls echoed out I
scarce repressed a cry.  A ragged streak
of lightning outside showed us the figure
of a man in the doorway, others behind him,
and the gleam of bare steel; then as the
light passed I sprang up, for in my ears
had shrilled up the long sobbing howl of
a wolf&mdash;a sound to wake the dead!
</p>

<p>
Wake me it did, and Grim too, for he
answered it with another and leaped
away from me.  We heard a startled yell
from the men, and then the old stranger
slammed the door before Grim could escape.
</p>

<p>
"Easy, old boy, easy!  Wait a bit till we
get a light."
</p>

<p>
With a dexterous flint and steel he soon
had the lanthorn going, to my no small
satisfaction.  Wat Herries was still
sleeping, which I wondered at.  I was still
blinking when the old man pulled me up
and took my hands in his.
</p>

<p>
"Davie, lad," he said softly, "you did
a good deed this night.  Now begone, and
fear not for me.  Those devils yonder
will come near me no more save in the
light of day."
</p>

<p>
"But&mdash;but&mdash;" I stammered fearfully,
"was it witchcraft or&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Witchcraft?  Forest craft, more like,"
he laughed, his white beard shaking at me.
"'Tis a gift the Lord and the Mohawks
gave me, but we will e'en give the Lord
credit, Davie.  So get you gone to sleep
and breathe no word of this."
</p>

<p>
Much reassured at finding he had no
dealings with the black art, though I
deemed his speech not far from blasphemy,
I caught hold on Grim and we both
returned to the main cabin, where all was
as we had left it and Alec Gordon still
arguing stoutly.  I flung down on a pile
of canvas and went to sleep with Grim still
in my arms, but that wolf-howl echoed
through and through my dreams that night
and I woke with it still in my ears.
Indeed, it then seemed scarce a thing of this
world, though I have since heard it often
enough.
</p>

<p>
When I went on deck next morning we
were in worse plight than ever, for it was
biting cold and there were masses of ice
around us, floating in the sea.  I learned
that we had been driven far north, where
the seas are full of ice even in June, but
it seemed a mighty strange thing to me.
There was some fog also, and every now
and then the "Lass" would heave her
bows into an ice-cake with a shivering
crash that boded ill for her timbers.
</p>

<p>
That day two of the womenfolk, both
Gordons, complained of a new sickness,
and Robin Grier said his teeth were loose
in his head.  My father and old Alec were
puzzled enough, but when the stranger
heard of it he ordered that the sick ones
be given naught save green stuff to eat.
That minded me of the talk I had overheard,
but a warning glance from the old
man checked the words on my lips.  It
was then we learned that many of the crew
were sick likewise, of that plague called
scurvy, which comes from eating no fresh
green things.  We were in sorry plight,
for save a few potatoes our green stuff
had all vanished long since.
</p>

<p>
That day there was no wind to speak
of, and I drew Ruth up into the bows
again, where we sat gloomily enough with
plaids wrapped around to keep out the
damp fog.  I had seen Gib o' Clarclach
once or twice, but he kept well out of my
way and out of sight as much as might
be.  I told Ruth all that had taken place
the night before, but at my fears of
witchcraft and wizardry she laughed outright.
</p>

<p>
"Yet the old man said himself that he
had been a chief among the red heathen
of the Colonies," I argued, "while his
speech was all but blasphemous."
</p>

<p>
Whereat she only laughed the more, and
I grew sulky until she pointed to a little
bunch of the crew in the shelter of the
rail below us, in the waist.
</p>

<p>
"I am more feared of them than of
any wizard, Davie," she said.  "This
terrible sickness is come upon us all, and we
cannot fight against it.  And see where
we are come&mdash;up into the sea of floating
ice!  With Master Herries laid up in his
bunk, and the men agog with superstition,
we are like to have an ill time ere we
reach the plantations."
</p>

<p>
"Just the same," I repeated stubbornly,
"I cannot see how any one can be a chief
among the heathen cannibals and still
remain a God-fearing man.  And why will
he not tell his name, and whence he
comes?"
</p>

<p>
This silenced Ruth for the time, and
though she laughed again I could see that
she was perplexed also.  But with the
contrariness of women she declared that the
talk wearied her, and so changed the topic
abruptly.
</p>

<p>
We lay idle for three days, with nothing
save ice and fog around us.  Then came
another gale, this time from the east, and
we began the weary fight once more.
Strangely enough, my father and rugged
old Lag Hamilton, with Alec Gordon
himself, were now feeling the scurvy; and we
were all of us frightened by it, and by
our own helplessness.  One of the dogs
had been lost overboard, having ventured
out on the deck in the storm, so thereafter
I kept Grim safe inside the cabin.
</p>

<p>
Of the old stranger we saw little during
those days.  He was busy tending Wat
Herries, which he did with the skill and
tenderness of a woman, and we were all
taken up with our own sick.  Whenever I
went on deck I saw that the crew obeyed
Black Michael with a sullen, surly
manner that boded ill.  Many of them were
sick also, and among these went Ruth
with such small comforts as we had, till
not a soul on board but loved her&mdash;save
possibly one.
</p>

<p>
On the third day of that gale matters
came to a head.  I do not think any of
us, save Ruth and I and the stranger,
suspected that the crew had aught in mind;
but had not my father been down with the
plague I would then have told him all.
The suspense was hard on me, almost too
hard to bear.  Day and night we had to
keep watch, twice narrowly missing great
mountains of ice, and on the third day we
struck a water-lashed cake with such force
that the "Lass" sprung a great leak.
</p>

<p>
When this was discovered the crew
well-nigh went mad with fear.  I was in the
cabin when the crash came, and ran to
the door with the others.  When Black
Michael ordered the men to the pumps,
they rebelled flatly, and before he could
so much as move he was trussed up like a
fowl in one of his own tarred ropes.  Then
knives flashed out in the light and the men
came surging aft.  I cried out to Robin
Grier and with our fathers' claymores,
which we fetched from the cabin on the
run, we stationed ourselves over the ladder
at the break of the poop, and called on
the men to halt.  Tam Graham and those
of the others who were not down with the
sickness came out behind us.
</p>

<p>
With a sudden loathing I recognized the
leader of the crew for Gib o' Clarclach.
He stood looking up with his evil grin, but
kept well out of reach of my weapon.
</p>

<p>
"Let us by, MacDonald," he spoke out.
"We are acting for the good of all, and
bring no harm to you and yours."
</p>

<p>
"That is a lie," I cried hotly.  "I know
well what you want, and you shall not pass
by this ladder, you rebels!  As for you, I
have met you before now, Gib o' Clarclach,
and know more of you than I did then.
You got little good out of your visit the
other night, and you will get little good
now.  Best stow away your knives and go
about your work."
</p>

<p>
The only answer I got was a howl of
rage from the men.
</p>

<p>
"The old wizard is Jonah!" yelled out
the fellow called Eoghan, with a flourish
of his long knife.  "Put him into the sea
again and let him go his way.  He has
bewitched us all, and we be dead men
unless we rid the ship of him!"
</p>

<p>
This talk staggered Robin, who wavered
and glanced at me, irresolute.  Tam
Graham muttered something behind me, and the
men below yelled again and came at the
ladder, seeing their advantage.  But I would
not give back, nor did I want to hurt any
of them, so I brought down the flat of
my father's claymore on Gib's crown, and
tumbled him to the deck, whereat all
drew back with a snarl.
</p>

<p>
As for Gib, he leaped to his feet and
drew back his hand quickly.  There came
a flash of something, and Robin dashed
me aside just in time to let a long knife
fly under my arm.  The scoundrel yelled
something at me in a strange tongue, but
before I regained my balance a sudden
silence fell upon them all, and they stared
past us.  Turning, I heard a whispered
prayer from Robin, and saw the old man.
</p>

<p>
He was standing just behind, a brass-bound
pistol in each hand, his knees giving
to the sway of the deck as the "Lass"
pitched.  Then a howl went up from the
crowd below.
</p>

<p>
"Wizard!" they yelled, some in English
and some in the Gaelic.  "Get you gone
and take your spells from us!"  And they
surged forward.  But the old man raised
his pistols, his white hair flying, and a
fierce flame raging in his eyes.  I think
those eagle-eyes halted them more than
the pistols, for they were in a mood to
care little for two bullets.
</p>

<p>
"Fools!" he cried in English, and yet
again.  "Fools!  Would you destroy your
only hope?  You dogs, I am Pierre
Radisson!"
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER VI.
<br /><br />
RADISSON THE GREAT.
</h3>

<p>
"Radisson!  Pierre Radisson!"
</p>

<p>
At the muttered word and the
blank look on the faces below I
could have laughed, but I make no doubt
that my own face looked as blank as theirs.
Not a soul on board but knew that name,
and in a flash it all came over me, till I
flushed with shame at my own suspicions.
</p>

<p>
Out of the world as we had been at
Ayrby, even I had heard this man's story.
It was said that he was a French-Canadian
by birth, and was the greatest
adventurer of our own times.  He had
found a great river to the west of the
Colonies, the same which Marquette and
La Salle explored, and later on had opened
up the Canadas to trade.  He it was who
had founded the Company of Gentlemen
Adventurers into Hudson's Bay, the fame
of which was great, and by the exploits
of his arms had kept them there against
the French.
</p>

<p>
But Radisson had found that the faith
of princes is a weak rod to lean upon.
First, the French had betrayed and robbed
him, which had sent him over to England.
Then, after the founding of the Great
Company, the very men to whom he had
brought fortunes had left him to starve,
denying him all share in the huge profits
they made in furs from the Canadas.  My
father had often dwelt on this story as
an example of the faith of kings.  Time
and again Radisson had swept the Bay of
French or English, but the ending of it all
was that he was thrown upon the streets
of London town.  How Pierre Radisson
came to be on board the "Lass," how he
had come into that little leaky sloop, I
knew not; but as I gazed on the stern
face of him I felt a sudden great thrill of
hope and eagerness.
</p>

<p>
The rebels felt more than that, for they
were mightily afraid of this man, who
had single-handed done such deeds in the
Canadas that all men had heard of him.
I caught a quick oath from below, saw
Gib o' Clarclach break away and vanish
forward, and so finished the mutiny.  With
a little laugh Radisson put away his
pistols.
</p>

<p>
"I will take charge of this ship," his
voice thrilled along the deck.  "Have no
more of this foolery.  Unloose the mate
yonder and go to your places.  By the
help of God we will come safe to shore yet."
</p>

<p>
Very silently and in great awe the men
unbound Black Michael, and in no long
time the ship was as it had been.  Robin
and Tam Graham and I stood wondering
at the break of the poop.  Radisson turned
to us with a courtly bow.
</p>

<p>
"Gentlemen, I thank you for your support.
The crew is like to be short-handed
ere we reach any port, and if need be I
will call upon you for help," said he.
</p>

<p>
Robin stared, his mouth agape, and old
Tam withdrew to tell the news in the
cabins, whither we followed him presently.
I looked about for Ruth, and found her
giving some broth to my father and Alec.
When this was done I took her out on deck
willy-nilly, for she needed a breath of air
and we cared little for the storm that still
raged.
</p>

<p>
Since men were in the bows watching
for ice ahead, we sat us down in the shelter
of the cabin, and presently Radisson came
thither and joined us.
</p>

<p>
"So now the mask is off," he said,
speaking in French, and smiling.  "I had
not thought to tell my name, but it must
needs out.  We are in a bad strait, my
friends."
</p>

<p>
"Why?" questioned Ruth.  "And why
not tell your name in the beginning?
Surely you had no hard thoughts of us?"
</p>

<p>
Radisson looked sadly into her eyes, and
smiled again.  "My child, I have fled from
England to die in mine own country.  They
would not let me go, they would not let
me work for them nor serve them, and
France has cast me out.  Yet the English
feared that I would serve France again,
and so when I had provided for my wife
and children I fled in secret to the coast
and embarked in that little sloop wherein
you found me.
</p>

<p>
"I had no hard thoughts, lass, but I am
suspicious of all men.  The wilderness is
my only home, and it is to the wilderness
that I go.  If I come to the Colonies, or to
New France, I shall be laid by the heels.
They seem to fear that my very presence
would work them ill."  He lifted his face
and looked to forget us as he gazed abroad
into the storm.  "Is there some curse
upon me, Lord God, that men fear me so?
Ah, to be once more on the open prairies
where the air is free of plots, with
red-skinned friends behind me and the
unknown world ahead!"
</p>

<p>
Those words sank deeply into my mind,
and there was to come a time when I would
remember them again; but Ruth leaned
forward and took his hand gently.  A right
strong hand it was, for all its age
unwrinkled and firm as mine own.
</p>

<p>
"Nay, speak not so bitterly," she
reproved him softly.  "There is no curse
upon any man, dear sir!  Come, you shall
go with us and join our settlement, and
when all is safely bestead you shall go and
come as you please, with none to hinder!"
</p>

<p>
"So?"  Radisson gazed down at her
unsmiling, and I felt on a sudden that there
might indeed be fear in his soul, but in
no wise a selfish fear.  "And whither is
this ship sailing?"
</p>

<p>
"What&mdash;"  Ruth stared up at him, her
wonder slowly changing to something more.
"You think&mdash;we are in danger?"
</p>

<p>
"Grave danger," he nodded confirmingly.
"None know it save Wat Herries your
master, and I, but we have been driven far
from our course to the Colonies.  Until I
can get sight of the sun I know not whither
we have drifted, but we are likelier to be
near Greenland than the Americas."
</p>

<p>
This told us nothing, for we knew not
that there was such a place as Greenland.
There was no more trouble with the crew,
who were all eager enough to do Master
Radisson's bidding.  But the scurvy was
now upon us sore, all having it save Ruth
and me and one or two others and Radisson
himself.  Two days later the storm ceased
as suddenly as it had begun, and that noon
Radisson and Black Michael busied
themselves with poor Wat's instruments, until
after an hour Radisson came below and
asked to see Alec Gordon.
</p>

<p>
"Sir," he said quietly, while I held up
old Alec's stricken head, "you must know
that we are far off our course, and in dire
need of green food, even if it be but grass.
Now I know these waters well, and if we
turn to our right course we will all be dead
ere we reach the Colonies.  But, an' it
please you, I can guide this ship into
Hudson's Bay and so to one of the posts
established by the Adventurers.  There we can
remain till Master Herries be recovered
and the sickness gone, when it will be no
great matter for him to lay a course for
the Colonies from there."
</p>

<p>
For a moment there was silence.  We
were all taken aback by this news and knew
not what to say, until finally Alec sank back
his head with a groan, speaking in the
Gaelic which I translated.
</p>

<p>
"Do your best, Master Radisson, and we
ask no more.  The Lord hath sent you to
us, and He knows His business best."
</p>

<p>
So it came about that our prow was no
longer turned to the south, but to the west.
Now, too, the winds favored us and drove
us onward full steadily, and the same day
our course was determined on, one of the
men found a sack of half-rotted potatoes in
the hold.  We hunted over, but found no
more.  These, however, served to stay the
sickness in a slight degree, and seemed to
the men to be a good omen.
</p>

<p>
For many days thereafter we stood forward
with the ice all around and with the
weather bitter, but without storms to hinder
and harass us.  In that time Pierre
Radisson drew ever closer to me and to Ruth,
sitting often with us and talking much of
his travels and adventures, one hand on
Grim and the other clasping mine or Ruth's.
On one of these occasions I asked him
about Gib o' Clarclach, called The Pike.
</p>

<p>
"The man is of your own country,"
answered Radisson, "though most of his life
has been spent among the French.  It was
in New France I found him first, and he
was a member of the party that went with
me from Montreal to the fur country.  He
was but a lad then, and of evil ways, but
a good fighter and of great resource.  When
we returned, our canoes deep-laden with a
rich cargo, it was he who urged the
Governor to seize the furs and betray me.
</p>

<p>
"After, I came to England.  When next
I came to the Great Bay whither we are
now bound, this fellow stirred up trouble
more than once, for he was dwelling among
the Chippewa nation, and he had become a
powerful man among them.  However, I
was no less powerful among the Crees, and
the Sioux to the far south, and on one
occasion we trapped The Pike with many of his
men.  It was thought then that he was
killed, but evidently he escaped to do more
evil in the world.  Long ago I swore
vengeance against him, and that vow will some
day be kept."
</p>

<p>
"But why did you not shoot him the day
he led the mutinous men?" I queried.  "If
the man had done me so much harm&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Peace, lad," commanded the old man
firmly, but kindly.  "I am older than you,
and such things I have learned to leave to
a higher hand than mine own.  Never fear,
this man will meet his punishment as God
wills, in God's own good time.  Mind you
not what the Scriptures say&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Aye, well enough," I broke in heatedly,
thinking on my first meeting with the man.
"But if the time ever comes when I stand
against him again, I will strike with no flat
blade then!  And besides," I added shrewdly,
"methinks there is more to the tale than
you have told."
</p>

<p>
Radisson smiled.  "Aye, lad, much more,
but the time is not come for the telling,
spitfire!"
</p>

<p>
"But, sir," cried out Ruth suddenly.
"how is it that you are taking our ship
into the Great Bay, when you feared so
much to fall into the hands of these men?
Will they not do you injury?"
</p>

<p>
"That may well be," answered Radisson
quietly.  "But I think God has sent me
to do my utmost for you and yours, maiden.
My own fate matters little, and it is even in
His hands.  I do not think He will let me
come to grief while I serve Him, child."
</p>

<p>
Ruth said nothing to this, but she gazed
at Radisson's sorrow-graven face with a
great admiration, in which I shared to the
full.  And in truth it was no little thing to
which he had set himself.  Were it known
that he was alive and in the fur country,
the English and French raiders would both
be after him.  Both nations had wronged
him deeply, and both feared and hated
him equally; for as my father used to
say, "If ye never do a man an injury,
Davie, you'll aye live in brotherly
love."  Thus it was with the great Pierre
Radisson.
</p>

<p>
He of all men had seen that there was
an unsuspected greatness in the country
north of the Canadas.  He had discovered
and opened up that country to the
fur-trade, and had received little thanks for
his pains.  Even his wanderings in the
far west were but little known, as he told
them to us during the voyage.  His brief
tale of Gib had shown me much of the
man's own greatness, for Radisson had
spoken without bitterness or rancor,
deeply as he had been wronged by the
traitor and spy.
</p>

<p>
So, if he took the "Lass" into Hudson's
Bay as he intended, and brought us safely
to one of the Adventurers' posts, he would
have little chance or none of getting away
free himself.
</p>

<p>
Of all on board, I think that only Ruth
and I understood this&mdash;save, mayhap, Gib
o' Clarclach, of whom now we saw nothing
at all.  In the days that followed our
talk with Radisson, I had no chance for
another spare hour with Ruth.  The illness
had seized upon the crew until we were
were very shorthanded, and with those of
our party who were able, I took place with
the sailors at the ropes.  There were but
half a dozen of us all left untouched, and
a few days later poor Maisie Graham died.
</p>

<p>
Her funeral was a gloomy enough matter,
for my father, looking like some great
gaunt specter, took the place of old Alec
and afterwards staggered back to his bed
again.  Ruth and those others of the women
who could, tended the sick.  At morn and
eve we gathered beside Alec and it was a
fearsome thing to hear the words of prayer
come from those blackened, disease-scarred
lips.  Yet those days of terror made a
man out of me who had been a boy, and
but for them I had never had the faith
and courage to meet what came after.
</p>

<p>
So we drove east and south through the
ice, great mountains of it all about us,
trusting everything to the old man who
led us on.  Then one day there came a
blue haze on the horizon, and a feeble
yell of joy went up from the men.  I
looked to see Radisson turn us in toward
the land, but he shook his head to my
questions.
</p>

<p>
"Nay, lad, that is but a barren ice-bound
coast.  We must on into the bay
itself and there, please God, we shall find
peace."
</p>

<p>
But the news that we were come to the
New World at last was wondrous heartening
to our sick, notwithstanding that two
of the men died that same day.  The leak
had gained greatly upon us, and the next
morning I felt signs of the illness for the
first time.  Ruth had not been touched by
it, and of the men only Gib, Radisson, and
one or two others had escaped.  But all
the women, poor folk, were in their beds.
</p>

<p>
Then we came to the great cliffs, stern
and icy.  A day later a gale came down
from the north and drove us onward into
the bay; and although this increased the
labor at the pumps, yet we welcomed it,
since it but sent us the faster toward safety.
And at length, as I came on deck at sunrise
to take up my watch, I heard a hoarse
shout from the weary men, and looking
across the floating ice at the dark shore,
saw a break of green that we had come
to in the night.

<h3>
CHAPTER VII.
<br /><br />
GRIM HOWLS.
</h3>

<p>
It was an inhospitable shore, seen through
the shreds of mist that were driving
in on us, but never was a heartier prayer
of thanks sent up than that which rose
from the "Lass" when the news had
spread.  The wind was falling and a fog
setting in, so that we were long in making
the shore, which seemed deserted.  Not
a curl of smoke went upward from all its
length.
</p>

<p>
Ruth and I stood on the poop, hand in
hand, watching that long-desired shore
until the fog had thickened and the wind
dropped.  At this Radisson ordered the
anchor put out, and I perforce assisted at
the task.  When I returned to Ruth she
was staring over the rail strangely.
</p>

<p>
"Davie," she asked in a low voice,
"does it not seem to you that the ship is
lower in the water this morning?"
</p>

<p>
"I had not seen it," I replied carelessly.
As I looked overside with her my heart
leaped up, for in truth the ship was sitting
low.  I knew that the leak had gained on us,
but evidently it was nothing serious, for the
men had made no outcry about it.
</p>

<p>
However, I had scant time to reassure
Ruth, for presently Radisson approached
us.  Grim tagged at his heels, for since my
father's illness the dog had taken to
following the old man around.
</p>

<p>
"Davie," he said, "pick out what men
can row and get the longboat over.  We
must make a camp here and relieve the
worst cases among the sick, then we can
go on to Albany, which I take to be the
nearest post."
</p>

<p>
Save for scattered cakes, the bay was
free enough of ice, but the fog now had
almost hid the shore from sight.  Only
three of the crew were able to row&mdash;Black
Michael, Gib and the sailor Eoghan.
That made the four of us, however, and
we made shift to get the longboat over
the side, by the help of Radisson and Ruth.
It was a sad and terrible sight, to watch
those others, who had been strong men
all, lying about the decks or gazing on us
with a wild stare of hope.
</p>

<p>
When the boat was over, we began
lading her as our captain ordered us, with
canvas, stores, powder, fusils and a host
of other things.
</p>

<p>
"We will set out a camp," declared
Radisson, when at length the boat was
laden to the gunwales.  "Then the sick
will go on shore while I gather herbs and
green things which I know well.  With
these, we will be enabled to overcome the
scurvy in a few days, I trust."
</p>

<p>
What might have passed for a feeble
cheer went up from the pathetic group
above us, but even as Radisson leaped
down into the boat, Eoghan went forward
over his oar with a single groan.  I tried
to pull him up, but the poor fellow could
not move.  The scurvy had taken hold on
him of a sudden, and he muttered that his
joints were aflame.  Radisson would have
taken his place, but with a flash Ruth was
over the rail and had pushed him away.
</p>

<p>
"I can row as well as you," she laughed.
"Save your strength, sir!  Yours is of
more worth to us than is mine."
</p>

<p>
"Aye, let the lassie go!"  And with
amazement I beheld my father clinging to
the rail above and staring down with
ghastly eyes.  "God speed your errand
and give you His blessing!"  Methought
he spoke more to me than Radisson, and
later this reflection has comforted me, for
this was the last word I ever had with
my father Fergus.
</p>

<p>
So Radisson nodded to Ruth and we
pushed away from the ship.  Then for the
first time I noticed that Grim had followed
us into the boat and was crouched in the
stern beside the old white-haired wanderer.
Over us gathered the other dogs, and the
last token we had as we pulled away into
the fog was the full-throated bark of Tam
Graham's Sandy.
</p>

<p>
There was no wind and the fog lay thick
and wet about us.  Ahead rose the gray
line of the shore, grim enough for all its
touch of green.  As I looked back at the
ship I realized more than ever the truth
behind those words of Homer, beaten into
my head by my father&mdash;"Let us go up
the sounding seas!"  For the water seemed
to rise behind until they met and blended
with the gray wall of mist above; and in
the midst, dim and ghostly, hung the "Lass
o' Dee."  That picture clung long in my
memory&mdash;that, and the brown shoulders of
Gib o' Clarclach rising and falling before
me on the after-thwart.
</p>

<p>
Presently Radisson cried to us to cease
rowing, and I glanced over my shoulder
to see a line of black rocks a few yards
away.  Black Michael, in the bow, fended
us in and sprang ashore with a shout of
rejoicing which we all echoed as we
followed him, even Grim catching the
enthusiasm and giving vent to a series of
loud barks.
</p>

<p>
Bleak rocks lay before and about us,
interspersed with small trees and bushes.
To one side a little cascading brook
trickled down over the rocks into the sea
with a quiet murmur.  But there was no
sign of human life within our limited range
of vision.
</p>

<p>
We were all chilled to the bone by that
heavy, dank fog, which by now had closed
in thicker than ever, so that when
Radisson said he would start a fire we began
unloading the boat with alacrity.  He
disappeared into the bushes, soon emerging
with an armful of sticks and bark.  By
means of my flint and steel we soon had a
fire blazing, dragged poor Eoghan up from
the boat, and clustered joyfully about the
warmth.
</p>

<p>
"David," said Radisson after a little,
"do you and your sister come with me.
We must see to curing this scurvy, which
I fear is getting into my old bones at last."
</p>

<p>
Catching Ruth's hand I pulled her up
with a laugh and we left Black Michael
and Gib staring at us dully, across the
half-senseless body of Eoghan.
</p>

<p>
"Wait, lad," Radisson pointed to a
clump of bushes.  "Do you stop here within
sight of the camp.  In this fog it were
an easy matter to get lost beyond repair.
Call to us every few moments and pluck
all these leaves you can carry.  Chew some
of them well, while Ruth and I go on
after others."
</p>

<p>
I fell to work on the bushes, cramming
my mouth full of the leaves and stuffing
my pockets with them.  I did not neglect
to call out frequently, Ruth's silvery voice
rising clearly in response.  Meanwhile I
carried some of the leaves to the men in
camp, and much to my surprise saw Gib o'
Clarclach just giving some to Black
Michael, so I merely thrust a few into
Eoghan's mouth and bade him chew for
his life.  It was plain that Gib had small
need of Radisson's services in this land.
</p>

<p>
In no great while Ruth and the old man
rejoined us, laden down with roots and
leaves of divers shapes.  These we bruised
between stones and with them filled a
kettle which had been fetched from the ship.
To this was put water, and the kettle was
then set over the fire.
</p>

<p>
"Now," ordered Radisson, "do you stay
here, Mistress Ruth, while we go fetch a
load of the sick.  Keep this brew simmering,
so it may be ready on our return."
</p>

<p>
We stepped toward the boat, but Gib
and Black Michael made no move to arise.
Radisson spoke to them sharply, whereat
Gib growled sullenly in French.
</p>

<p>
"Do the work yourself, an' you will!
I be not going to budge from solid earth
for you or&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
He got no farther, for Radisson took one
long step to his side, his stern old face
livid with sudden fury.  Seizing the man
by the throat, he lifted him with one hand
and dashed him back to the ground, like
as I have seen my father dash a spider
from him.
</p>

<p>
"Obey me, you dog!  Get to the boat,
both of you, lest I forget myself!"
</p>

<p>
Coming from the old man of seventy, the
words may seem ludicrous enough; but
there was that in his voice which brought
the two men to their feet without a word
more.  Sullenly they stepped into the boat
while Radisson watched them.  Then he
turned to me.
</p>

<p>
"In with you, Davie!  We'll leave Ruth
to take care of Eoghan."
</p>

<p>
"Willingly," she laughed gayly, then
added more soberly, "You'll bring father
back in the first boat, Davie?"
</p>

<p>
"That we will, lass," I made hearty
answer, and she watched us off, her hand
resting on Grim's head.  The ship was
hid from us in the fog, but Radisson had
her compass-bearing from the shore.  Now
there happened a fearsome thing, a thing
which has made my blood run chill
many a night since.
</p>

<p>
Just before the shore was closed from
sight, I saw Grim lift his head from Ruth's
hand and utter one long howl.  So mournful
was that voice, so terrible in the loneliness
around, that it drew a curse from
Black Michael, and I shivered despite
myself.  And in this same moment came
another howl&mdash;but now from the fog ahead
of us&mdash;a long deep cry which I recognized
for old Sandy's, and it was cut short in
the midst as by his master's hand.  But
Tam Graham was lying sick between decks,
as we well knew.
</p>

<p>
And with that I felt that something was
wrong.  I believe that we all sensed it, for
the others fell to their oars and Radisson's
shaggy white brows drew far down.  Knowing
Grim as I did, I was far more fearful
than the others; only once before had I
heard such sound from his throat, and that
was on the day my mother died.
</p>

<p>
So as I pulled I cast glances over my
shoulder, seeking the ship, and sudden
remembrance of Ruth's words that morning
put haste into my oar.  My mind was full
of its uneasy fear, and it was full five
minutes before I realized that we should
have come to the ship ere this.  I could
see naught of her in the fog, and when I
looked to Radisson I saw him studying
his compass and peering about.
</p>

<p>
"Have we lost the 'Lass'?" I cried
between strokes.
</p>

<p>
"Strange!" he muttered, frowning.  "I
had her bearings right enough, but&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Black Michael cried out in Gaelic that we
were of a surety bewitched, and for a
moment my heart failed me and I stared at
Radisson in horror.
</p>

<p>
"Her cable was not strong," spoke up
Gib, who had lost his surliness of a
sudden.  "Mayhap it parted and sent her
adrift."
</p>

<p>
"There is no wind to drift her,"
answered Radisson, perplexed.  "Yet we
heard the dogs howl plain enough.  What
make you of it, Davie?"
</p>

<p>
"God knows!" I half sobbed, staring
back over my shoulder in the shuddering
fog, that seemed to stifle us, so thick was
it.  An old word came into my head, and
out I blurted it.  "Ill's the wind when
dogs howl."
</p>

<p>
At this Black Michael uttered a savage
Gaelic oath that was half pure fear, and
paused on his oar.  For a little we drifted
thus, the sullen seas heaving beneath us,
driving us slowly up and down yet giving
us no sign of what lay beyond that curtain
of gray.  It was uncanny, and I shivered
again until my oar was all but lost.
</p>

<p>
"Give me that fusil," commanded
Radisson.  I took up the gun, which was ready
loaded, and passed it to him.  Lifting it,
he fired in the air.  There was no answer
save a dull echo and the lap-lap of water
on our sides.  Black Michael went gray
with sheer fright.
</p>

<p>
"Strange," exclaimed Radisson again,
and even his deep voice was shaken.
"What think you of it, Jean?"
</p>

<p>
I remembered later how then he turned
to the man he hated above all others, and
I respected him the more for it.  Gib, for
it was he whom Radisson addressed, leaned
over and snatched something from the
water.
</p>

<p>
"This, Sieur Radisson."
</p>

<p>
He held up a dripping object.  We all
stared at it, then I felt my heart leap,
and I uttered a cry of horror&mdash;for the
thing was the front cover of my father's
Bible!
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><a id="chap08"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER VIII.
<br /><br />
DESERTED.
</h3>

<p>
Even that hardened villain Gib was
shocked at this discovery.  He handed
the soaked leather cover to me in
silence, and when I raised my face I saw
Radisson gazing at me, a great sadness in
his eyes.  I stammered out what the thing
was, and thereafter silence fell upon us all.
</p>

<p>
I knew full well that some dire thing
had happened before that sacred Bible
could have been wrenched asunder in my
father's hands, for seldom indeed had it
ever left him.  I stood up on the seat and
shouted in a frenzy of fear, for that
horrible fog set badly on my soul.
</p>

<p>
"Father!  Father!  Where are you?"
</p>

<p>
But through the mist came only one
faint reply&mdash;a weird howl from the throat
of Grim.  I sank back staring and
Radisson gave a short order.
</p>

<p>
"Pull, all of you!  Somewhat has
happened to the ship, plain enough.  Yet may
we rescue some of the poor souls aboard
her, if it be God's will."
</p>

<p>
We gave way with desperate energy, but
though we rowed back and forth in that
blanketed fog for nigh an hour, we found
no sign of Wat Herries' ship other than
the torn, watersoaked fragment of leather
that lay in my shirt bosom.  Despair sat
heavily upon us all, and at length Radisson,
his face haggard and terrible, swept us
about and we gave up the vain search.
</p>

<p>
It must be that the touch of scurvy and
the hardships of that voyage had sapped
my strength, and that this horrible day
had set a finish upon it, for I remember
nothing more save staggering to the camp,
when we had reached the shore, and
meeting Ruth as she advanced.  Then I fell
forward, my arms going about Grim's
shaggy neck; I tried to sob out something,
and therewith fainted dead away.
</p>

<p>
I recovered to find Ruth feeding me a
bitter herb-brew, which I pushed from me
as I sat up.  My head had been in her
arms, and when my eyes met hers I
remembered all, and near cried out but with
the shock of the memory.  For the grief in
her sweet face showed all too clearly that
she had been told of the tidings.  Then
Grim licked my hand, whereat I rose to my
feet; it came to me in that instant that
there was a new burden now on my shoulders,
and that I must show myself for a
man indeed.
</p>

<p>
"Here, Davie," cried out Radisson,
"come and help me with this canvas.
Ruth, give Eoghan some more of that
brew."
</p>

<p>
I joined him and the other two, and
under his guidance we stretched the canvas
into some semblance of a tent that would
make a rude shelter for us.  When this had
been done to his liking, Radisson had us
rear, a little distance off, a shedlike cover
of boughs over which he flung our plaids.
This was for the use of Ruth.
</p>

<p>
"Come, lad," and a heavy hand fell on
my shoulder.  "No more of this staring
into the fog-cloud; help us gather
firewood against the night."
</p>

<p>
Turning, I looked into the face of Black
Michael and recognized his rough but kindly
attempt to hearten me.  I had not thought
it of him, so dark and sullen the man
was ever, and the memory of those few
words has always touched him kindly in
my mind.  So I helped him gather wood,
after which we made a sorry enough meal,
our first in the New World.
</p>

<p>
Eoghan was somewhat recovered by
now, and the leaves and brew had done
us all good, even in that little time.  But
none the less we were in desperate case,
and our gathering was a quiet one.  When
the meal was done Radisson beckoned me
to one side.
</p>

<p>
"Come you for a little exploring, David."
</p>

<p>
But when we had left the camp and
were among the trees, his tone changed
and he gripped me by the shoulder,
whirling fiercely upon me.
</p>

<p>
"Lad, there be three fusils and five
horns of powder yonder in the camp.  Get
them all safe stowed away in hiding, for
we may have trouble from these men ere
long."
</p>

<p>
I stared at him agape.  "Why, do you
fear&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Obey orders!" he snapped.  Then, his
face relaxing from its anxious tensity, he
continued more kindly.  "Aye, I fear that
for one thing the ship is lost, David.  When
this cursed fog lifts we shall know for
certain; but hope for little.  I misdoubt
that great howl from the dogs; besides,
there was no answer to our cries or shot.
All those aboard her were too weak to
man the pumps, and I fear she has filled
and gone down at her anchor."
</p>

<p>
I was about to make reply when he
checked me.
</p>

<p>
"We have ourselves to depend on,
David.  Brace up, lad&mdash;remember that your
sister must be saved by us."
</p>

<p>
"Saved&mdash;from what?" I repeated.  "We
have the boat and can make our way&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Peace," he cried.  "You know nothing
of the dangers about us, even in our
own party.  Do my bidding in the matter
of the fusils and powder.  Say as little as
may be to anyone, especially to Ruth, for
I may be wrong and it were not well
to alarm her.  Go now&mdash;I will return
presently."
</p>

<p>
So in no little alarm and perplexity I
returned, to find no change in affairs at the
camp.  The three fusils and the powder
were easily secured and I placed them in
Ruth's shelter in charge of Grim.  The
weather remained as it had been, the fog
still heavy on the waters.
</p>

<p>
Side by side, Ruth and I sat near the
fire for hours.  In truth, the poor maid
was drooping with sheer fatigue.  I, poor
lout, could think of naught cheering to say
to her, and so we sat and listened to the
lapping of the waves below and the chance
talk of the three men.  I mentioned it not
to Ruth, but the more I saw of Gib the
more I feared and hated the fellow, though
for no very tangible reason save the words
of Radisson.  And those I understood but
dimly for many days to come.
</p>

<p>
Toward the sunset Radisson returned to
us, bearing two dead rabbits.  These were
prepared and Ruth cooked them, giving us
a wholesome change from the salt meat.
Gradually the darkness fell, and we built
up the fire until its warmth gave us such
a glow as we had not known for weeks.
</p>

<p>
That night Radisson told us many stories
of his adventures in this very country and
in the Canadas to the south.  He told how
he had been captured as a lad by the
Mohawk Indians and how he had finally
become a great man among them, before
returning to his own people.  Then he
told of that great empire of the redmen,
called the Five Nations, of which the
Mohawks are the greatest; of his later travels
in the west and of how he had discovered
that great river called "Father of Waters"
by the Indians, which in later days had
been "discovered" anew, for Radisson
never stood well with the Papists.  To his
stories the men listened eagerly, Gib with
a half sneer, but little did I heed their
glumness.  Ruth and I forgot ourselves in
Radisson's words, which was perhaps as he
had intended.
</p>

<p>
So drew that day to a close.  Seldom
in my life have I known a more terrible
one&mdash;not from its actual danger, but from
the mere awfulness of the unknown.  Only
once have I felt greater terror, and of
that you shall hear in its proper place.
</p>

<p>
In the night a little breeze arose.  I
woke once to find Radisson building the
fire anew, and cast my eyes toward the
star-hung waters.  But no ship's light could
I see, and I think I sobbed myself to
sleep in misery of heart, for I remember
Gib cursing me in some strange tongue.
</p>

<p>
With the morning our worst fears
were confirmed.  There before us lay the
blue bay glittering in the sun, but never a
sign of the "Lass o' Dee."  To north
and west the shore stretched, while the
country behind us seemed thickly wooded
and deserted.  It was a strange thing, to
me at least, to see all that land with not
a single spiral of smoke curling up from
any farm or stead.
</p>

<p>
That the ship had sunk with all on
board, I no longer had any doubt.
Fortunately, we had good store of provisions,
and as I sat with Ruth that morning and
gazed out across the water, I did my best to
cheer up the poor maid.  The loss of my
father and the rest was a great shock to
her, coming as it had, but she was never
much given to grieving and sat there
dry-eyed.  Pretty enough she looked, despite
her grief, for her yellow hair fell braided
over her shoulders and her great violet
eyes stared out from beneath her fine, high
brows.  Looking at her in this moment, I
was startled by a likeness of her profile
to that of old Radisson; howbeit, I said
nothing of it at the time.
</p>

<p>
No sooner had we made sure of the
ship's loss than Radisson vanished with
one of the fusils, and after a time we
heard a faint shot.  The men were already
like new, the scurvy symptoms vanishing
rapidly before the herb-brew and roots, and
I myself could feel the great change which
these had worked in me.
</p>

<p>
Slowly the morning drew on, and then
Radisson appeared bearing parts of a
deer-like animal he called a caribou.  When
we had eaten and drunk we felt wondrous
better, both in body and mind.
</p>

<p>
"It is hard to realize," said Ruth very
soberly, "that we alone are left alive out
of all that ship's company.  It seems like
some evil dream."
</p>

<p>
"It is no dream, maid," returned Radisson
sadly, "but cold reality.  It behooves
us to make some plan, my friends.  Where
think you we are, Jean?"
</p>

<p>
And now for the second time Gib
answered to the French name.  Truly, he
seemed a person of many titles.
</p>

<p>
"I would say to the northwest of
Albany," he replied slowly, cocking his evil
face up at the sky.  "The southern shore
is lower than this, methinks.  We might
be near those barren lands the Chippewas
tell of."
</p>

<p>
Radisson nodded.  "So it seemed to me,
although I have never been up through
these more northern lands.  Then our best
plan will be to go south in the boat.  Surely
we ought to reach the fort within a day
or so, and then&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Radisson paused suddenly.  I saw the
eyes of Gib grow small and cold and hard,
and they met those of the old wanderer
insolently.
</p>

<p>
"And then?"  He repeated half mockingly,
with a triumphant leer.  "England
and France are at peace, in these parts!
And perchance the Governor would pay as
well for a certain hostage we wot of as
would certain parties in New France."
</p>

<p>
Radisson said nothing, but looked at the
man steadily for a long while, though I
saw the cords of his neck bulge out.  At
length the bold eyes of Gib shifted and
then fell beneath that intent look, and our
leader spoke calmly and quietly.
</p>

<p>
"I think we will all be able to row in the
morning.  We will start then.  If need be,
we can make a sail of this canvas.  This
afternoon we will reload the boat."
</p>

<p>
Now it seemed to me that a single swift
glance passed between Gib and Black
Michael.  Then the latter wagged his great
beard dubiously.
</p>

<p>
"I fear me we are in no great spirit for
rowing, Master Radisson," he grumbled,
although an hour before he had been
working well enough over the fire.  "My
joints are sore, and Eoghan here can barely
move."
</p>

<p>
"Fool, to take Pierre Radisson for a
child!"  That was all the old man said,
but before his eyes Black Michael seemed
to shrink back in confused silence.  If this
kept on, I knew that Radisson would be
goaded into action we might all regret;
albeit, boylike, I rejoiced thereat as the
thought came to me.  Then I fell to
pondering on that puzzle which had vexed
me so sore&mdash;Gib o' Clarclach.  Who was
he?  Had Radisson told me truly or no?
And who was this hostage of whom he had
spoken?  But I knew no more at the end
of that pondering than I knew at the
beginning.
</p>

<p>
During the afternoon we loaded most of
our goods back into the boat, so that in the
morning we might make a start.  Most of the
provisions were put aboard, together with
the spare clothes and other things we had
fetched from the ship, but the fusils,
powder and shot I left where they had been
hid.  And fortunate it was that I did so,
as events fell out.
</p>

<p>
To tell the truth, I think Ruth grieved
more for my father than did I.  He had
ever been a hard man, just but stern in all
things, and I had been more my mother's
son while she lived.  The thing was rather
a shock than a heart-grief to me, I verily
believe, and bitterly have I reproached
myself that it was so, but without avail.
</p>

<p>
That night I noticed that Black Michael
cast anxious glances at us, and the sailor
Eoghan stared more than once at the gold
brooch at Ruth's throat.  I thought long
on this, and it brought again to my mind
that scene on the beach near Rathesby,
when Gib and the other had fallen to
staring at the brooch also.  What might the
thing be, and whose arms were those
graven upon it?  But this Ruth knew as
little as I, and I concluded that the men
were but attracted by the glitter of the
massy gold, as was like enough.
</p>

<p>
This night fell warm and clear, very
different from that before.  Now Radisson
and I lay together, the other three sleeping
beyond us and nearer to the fire.  I
wrapped my plaid about me, as I had done
many a time on the moors at home, and
fell asleep almost at once; as yet I was
none too strong, and even the little work
done that day had wearied me.  Grim lay
beside Ruth's shelter.
</p>

<p>
How long I slept I know not, but when
I wakened the fire had died down to a red
glow.  I lay wondering what had roused
me, then sat up.  The place where Gib
had lain was vacant.
</p>

<p>
But I was too sleepy to waste time on
such little things, and so rolled over again
and dropped off.  When next I opened mine
eyes it was to find Radisson bending over
and shaking me roughly.
</p>

<p>
"Waken, David!"  Something in that
deep rich voice of his brought me to my
feet.
</p>

<p>
"What is it?" I cried, staring about into
the new dawn.  "What is the matter?"
</p>

<p>
"Matter enough," replied the old man
gravely.  "The men have gone off with
the boat, lad, and we are deserted!"
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER IX.
<br /><br />
THE GREAT ADVENTURE BEGINS.
</h3>

<p>
I looked around, dazed.  Of the three
men there was no sign, and the boat
was gone from the shore.  As I stared,
scarce believing mine own eyes, Ruth and
Grim came toward us.  The lassie had heard
the news already, for at my exclamation of
anger she tried to hearten us with a laugh,
and slipped her hand into that of Radisson.
</p>

<p>
"Never mind, Davie, we are better off
without them!  So put that black look from
your face and let them go, since they will
have it so; they will only fetch us succor
the sooner."
</p>

<p>
Radisson but grunted&mdash;a habit he had
when words failed him.
</p>

<p>
"The cowards!" I broke forth hotly,
staring across the vacant waters.  "'Tis
little we can look to them for, Ruth.  To
steal off and leave us in our sleep!"  And
I told how I had awakened during the night.
</p>

<p>
"You know not the danger, either of
of you."  Radisson shook his head gloomily,
the while his fine eyes searched the
woods about us.  "We must pack what we
can carry on our backs.  It may be that
we shall yet reach the post in safety
before them."
</p>

<p>
I saw no reason why we must hasten to
reach the fort ahead of the scoundrels, but
at the time it seemed too small a matter to
call for exposition.  Our leader was no
man to bide inactive.  We had each a fusil,
and good store of powder and shot, while
food was to be had for the getting, it
seemed.  I began to think that this land
might not be so barren after all.
</p>

<p>
What was left to us we made into two
bundles, Radisson taking one and I the
other.  Then we set off along the brook,
inland.  The country was high and bare,
save for bushes and evergreen trees, but of
heather I saw none; indeed, as I learned
later, there was none of our proper heather
in all this New World.
</p>

<p>
As Radisson believed Fort Albany to be
toward the southeast, our best plan was
to follow the course of the streamlet,
which turned from the shore toward the
south.  We were soon lost in the tangle of
bush, and about noon left the stream
altogether.  Then it developed that the three
deserters had taken Radisson's compass;
but of this our leader recked little, for
he guided us by some sixth sense which
he averred was part of the Indian training.
</p>

<p>
Despite the rough ground and our
loads, we must have made full ten or
twelve miles that day, and with nightfall
camped beside a river of goodly size,
making our dinner from a hare which Grim
fetched in.  It was late before I could
sleep, the woods around being filled with
strange noises and the calls of birds and
animals.  In the morning I had my first
sight of the men of the New World.
</p>

<p>
I was about building a fire, on a big
rock by the river's edge, when I heard a
voice from the water.  Looking up, I saw
three canoes poised noiselessly in the
stream, each bearing two dark-skinned
men whose hair was hung in braids and
who were naked to the waist.  Their faces
were not painted, as in Radisson's stories,
and all were staring at me as at some
wondrous marvel.
</p>

<p>
I cried out and sprang for a fusil, but
the paddles swept down once, and even
as Radisson awoke the first Indian leaped
ashore.  I was trying to load a fusil in
haste, but Radisson sprang up and halted
me after a quick look at the red men.
</p>

<p>
"Down with the gun, lad.  These be friends."
</p>

<p class="capcenter">
<a id="img-040"></a>
<img class="imgcenter" src="images/img-040.jpg" alt="&quot;Down with the gun, lad. These be friends.&quot;" />
<br />
&quot;<i>Down with the gun, lad. These be friends.</i>&quot;
</p>

<p>
All six of them landed now, but stopped
their advance with a guttural word of
surprise at sight of the old wanderer.  I laid
my hand on Grim's bristling neck.
</p>

<p>
"What cheer!" said Radisson in English.
"Has Soan-ge-ta-ha forgotten his friend
the White Eagle?"
</p>

<p>
One of the Indians, older than the rest,
gravely took the extended hand of Radisson
and made reply in very good English,
to my surprise.
</p>

<p>
"Brave Heart has not forgotten the
Eagle, although his young men know him
not, and the winters have left their snows
on his hair.  Will the Eagle and his
children go to the post with us?"
</p>

<p>
At this Radisson broke into a strange
tongue and I could make nothing of the
talk that ensued.  Ruth had come to my
side and was watching the red men
somewhat fearfully, while in their turn they
bestowed open admiration upon her.  Soon
they came forward and bunched around
the fire while they talked.  After a little
Radisson turned to me, and spoke rapidly,
in French.
</p>

<p>
"Davie, these be men of the Chippewa
nation, who will take us to the fort.  On
your life speak not in English of Gib!"
</p>

<p>
While I was puzzling over this command,
Ruth had turned to the speaker.
</p>

<p>
"But why do you go thither?" she
asked anxiously.  "Surely you could send
us with&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Nay, daughter," replied the old
wanderer, "these are not to be trusted,
although they fear to deceive or harm me.
Say no more, for we go to the post."
</p>

<p>
He drew a deep breath, then took one of
our fusils and presented it to the chief,
Brave Heart.  The gift was received with
a murmur of joy, and although I could
make nothing of the words, the eyes of
the six Indians betrayed the fierce delight
in their hearts at the gift.  But there was
no gratitude mingled with that delight, and
as they sat and eyed the gift methought I
could see the murder-lust in their glances.
It has always seemed to me that the
Adventurers to whose post we were going,
have done little good; for in all that land
north of New France they have but taught
the red men to slay and slay for skins, and
mingled little enough of the word of God
with the word of man.  Howbeit, to my
story.
</p>

<p>
It is not my purpose to detail the
strange customs and sights which Ruth and
I saw during the next few days and nights
while we paddled up that river.  To others
they might not seem so strange as they did
to us, and moreover I have greater things
to tell of which befell later.  Soan-ge-ta-ha,
or Brave Heart, had known Radisson both
as friend and foe, years before, and very
plainly held the old man in vast respect
and fear.
</p>

<p>
For two days we ascended the river,
then came a portage where the canoes
and furs were carried for a mile or more
to another stream, which we descended this
time.  On the third day we met another
party of four natives, also Chippewas, who
exchanged words with Brave Heart, greeted
us with a mingling of fear and awe, and
pushed on ahead.
</p>

<p>
"They cannot understand it," laughed
Radisson in French, which these others
knew not.  "They have seen no ship along
the coast and are beginning to think the
Great Spirit dropped us here from the sky."
</p>

<p>
I marveled at the credulity of the poor
creatures, and suggested that it was wrong
so to deceive them, whereat Radisson
looked queerly at me.  As Ruth failed to
agree, I dropped the subject for the time,
although I liked not to continue in such
standing, which to my mind savored of
deceit and well-nigh blasphemy.  By this
you may see that I was no little changed
from the young lout who had slipped out
of the Purple Heather at Rathesby to skip
the prayers&mdash;as well I might be, after the
horror of that voyage and its ending.
</p>

<p>
We traveled each in a separate canoe,
seeing little of each other save at the
halting places.  On one of these occasions
Radisson told me why he had ordered no
mention made of Gib.  It seemed that the
fellow was of no little reputation among the
Chippewas, even as was Radisson among
other tribes, and if his return to the New
World were known things might go ill.
</p>

<p>
Ruth made light of the hardships of
those first days, although Brave Heart's
men treated her with all consideration.
Both she and I gained some slight knowledge
of the art of paddling, and I found
that the scurvy had altogether disappeared,
whereat I thanked God most fervently.
</p>

<p>
It seemed that the Chippewa chief, Soan-ge-ta-ha,
was one of the greatest among his
own people.  He was not so old as Radisson,
but his face held a stern, implacable
aspect which at times set me athrill with
fear of the man.  I prayed that we might
never have him to face as an enemy, nor
at that time did such an event seem
probable.
</p>

<p>
And as we paddled I grew ever more
amazed at the great size of this new land,
which seemed to have neither limit nor
end.  On we went, crossing from one
stream to another.  We had been with the
six Chippewas for eight days, and on the
fifth day after meeting the four others
Soan-ge-ta-ha announced the post was only
three days' journey off.  Of this we were
right glad, and if Radisson felt in any
other wise he gave no sign.
</p>

<p>
But we were not destined to accompany
the six farther, for here happened
one of those wonderful things which
showed ever more plainly that the hand of
God was over us, guiding and protecting
us from hidden dangers.  We had just
made ready to embark when Soan-ge-ta-ha
lifted his hand in a warning gesture, and
Grim gave a low growl.  As he did so,
the bushes on the farther side of our
camping-place parted, and out stepped two men.
</p>

<p>
But what men they were!  Ruth gave a
little cry and settled back within my arm,
while the Chippewas emitted a grunt of
surprise.  Both the men were Indians&mdash;just
such savages as Radisson had described
to us while on the "Lass."  Naked
to the waist like our own six, the face and
breast of each was hideously painted with
red and white paint, and they wore
pantaloons of skin, beaded and fringed
wondrously.  Each was taller than the average
man, and their heads were in part shaven
so that a single long lock of hair was left,
and in this were twisted eagle feathers.
As they came closer I saw that for all
their sturdiness these were old men, in
years if not in vigor.  They carried no
muskets, but at their belts were hatchets
and knives.  For an instant we all stared
as if rooted to the ground, then to my utter
amazement Radisson leaped forward and
threw his arms about the first savage.
</p>

<p>
"My brother&mdash;my brother!" he cried
out in French, all his heart in his voice.
"Am I dreaming or bewitched?  Can this
thing be possible?"  He turned and caught
the other likewise.  "And you, Swift
Arrow&mdash;is it you or some ghost of the olden
days?"
</p>

<p>
As if this were not surprise enough for
me, these grave painted savages of the
New World made dignified response in
French.  Nay, it was poor French enough,
yet Ruth and I could sense it with ease.
</p>

<p>
"Now are we indeed happy," spoke the
older of the two, paying no heed to us who
watched in amazement.  "My brother,
many snows ago you left us.  We heard
that you had gone to the Great Father
across the big water.  Then it was borne
to us that you were far in the north, here
among the snows.
</p>

<p>
"My brother, our lodges were empty.
We mourned for you in the Long House
among the Nations.  There was no war
among us and we grew old.  So we bade
our people farewell and left the land of
the Long House to seek you.  My brother,
we have found you, and we thank the
Great Spirit.  We, who were young together,
shall grow old together and travel
the Ghost-trail together.  I, Ta-cha-noon-tia
the Black Prince, Keeper of the Eastern
Door, have said it."
</p>

<p>
For an instant there was a tense silence.
I did not realize what the speech
portended, but I could see Radisson's face,
and I watched it glow in the morning sun
until it seemed as if youth had once more
touched it lightly for an instant, so
glorified was it.  Then Soan-ge-ta-ha made a
step forward, for he knew no French.
</p>

<p>
"Who are these?" he asked, sweeping
a hand toward the strangers with a frown.
"What do they in the country of the
Chippewas?"
</p>

<p>
The pair seemed to sense the spirit of
the words if not their meaning, for they
drew themselves up proudly and topped
the Chippewas by a head.  It was Radisson
who made hasty answer.
</p>

<p>
"These are brothers of mine from the
far south, Brave Heart.  They came in
search of me, and are on no war trail."  He
turned and addressed the two in a
strange, guttural tongue.  They made answer
with a few gestures.  I saw Radisson
cast a quick look at me; there was that in
his face which spelled danger.  Therewith
he turned to the Chippewas again.
</p>

<p>
"Soan-ge-ta-ha has been generous to his
friends, as befits a great chief, and we
thank him.  Let him keep our gifts in
token of friendship, for we may go no
farther with him.  We depart from this place
with these my brothers."
</p>

<p>
The Chippewas glanced at the two
impassive figures, and there was greed in
their eyes as they took in the exquisite
garments, the fine weapons, the&mdash;ah, what
was that dark line fringing the belts?
Radisson had told me of the strange
custom of wearing an enemy's hair, and I
turned away my eyes as I recognized only
too plainly the scalps that fringed the
girdles of these two old strangers.
</p>

<p>
Soan-ge-ta-ha eyed Radisson for an instant.
Perhaps he had a conflicting mind,
but if so he thought better of it, for he only
nodded and spoke briefly to his warriors.
These, without a word to us, leaped into
the loaded canoes, and with a last wave
from the chief the six pushed off into the
stream.
</p>

<p>
"What did he say?" spoke up Ruth
hurriedly.  "Why is this?  Be these men
going to take us to the post?"
</p>

<p>
Radisson came and took her hand, speaking
in English.
</p>

<p>
"My child, these men have done what
few had dared attempt&mdash;they have come
here from below the Canadas, far to the
south, in search of me.  They belong to the
Mohawk nation, the greatest tribe of the
Iroquois, and long ago I lived with them
and loved them.  Ruth, these are two great
men in their own land, famous both of
them&mdash;they&mdash;they&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Here his emotion choked him, for he
turned his face away and I saw a tear upon
his white beard.  After a moment he
caught my hand with Ruth's and turned
about.  Now he spoke in French.
</p>

<p>
"Ta-cha-noon-tia, Black Prince, you who
ward the Eastern Door of the Long House
of the Five Nations, and you, Ca-yen-gui-nano,
Great Swift Arrow, I give into your
friendship and protection this young man,
who is as mine own son, and this girl, who
is the daughter of mine own sister."
</p>

<p>
And at that Ruth gave a great cry and
caught Radisson by the hands, staring at
him wildly.

<h3>
CHAPTER X.
<br /><br />
THE KEEPER AND THE ARROW.
</h3>

<p>
"What mean you?" she broke
forth, searching his smiling
face.  "Is this a jest, sir?  Or
do you really know&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"My child," and Radisson caught her to
him, touching her brow with his lips, "it
is no jest.  But we are in grave danger
here.  Come, greet these noblest of men,
and let us begone.  The tale I will give
you in full at the first chance."
</p>

<p>
Both the two Mohawks and I had
looked on at this scene with no little
bewilderment.  But as Ruth obeyed him and
turned to them with a puzzled smile, the
elder, whom we came to know as the
Keeper, stepped forward and caught her
hand to his lips in right courtly
fashion&mdash;doubtless learned at Montreal.
</p>

<p>
"The Yellow Lily need fear not, for we
are brothers of the White Eagle," and he
glanced at Radisson, then turned to me.
His black eyes glittered intensely as they
swept over me, but it was his companion,
the Arrow, who spoke.  Doubtless he put
his Mohawk thought into French speech,
for the words were abrupt.
</p>

<p>
"The young man with brave eyes is
good to look upon.  He is our brother."
</p>

<p>
"Then we will care for the Yellow Lily
together," I smiled at Ruth, using the name
they had bestowed upon her.  This pleased
them hugely, and a smile flickered across
their dark faces.  Presently they and
Radisson were chattering in the strange
tongue, and when he turned to us there was
doubt in his strong face, for once.
</p>

<p>
"My children, we are in a narrow path.
These twain have lived for two years
among the Cree people, daily waiting my
coming.  But a few days since they had
journeyed to the post.  Gib, Eoghan and
Black Michael had arrived in the boat.  No
sooner was their story told than men were
sent out in all directions in search of us,
while among the Chippewas a price was
set on our heads in beads and blankets.
</p>

<p>
"What!" I cried indignantly.  "Would
they dare&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Peace, lad.  You know not all the tale,
and it is too long to be told here.  There
is no law in these parts save that of the
strongest, and the Keeper and the Arrow
set forth to find us.  Fortunately,
Soan-ge-ta-ha had not heard the news, else he had
not let us go so easily.  As I will explain
later, it is impossible for Ruth to seek the
post.  The only thing left us is to go
with my friends here and find refuge
among the Crees to the west.  There we
shall be safe, for the Crees are old friends
of mine.  The Mohawks have two canoes
hidden a few miles from here.  Let us go
on with them, and we can take to the
water on another river.  This will throw
off any pursuers until we can find shelter
among friends."
</p>

<p>
I glanced at Ruth, despair in my eyes.
She read the look and came to me, putting
her hand on my arm.
</p>

<p>
"Davie, dear, there is naught else to do.
Have no fear for me, but let us trust in
God.  Remember, we have much to talk
of and we do not know all that has passed.
Are you willing to go into the wilderness
with us?"
</p>

<p>
"Willing?" I burst out, seizing her hand.
"Aye, for myself I care naught, Ruth, but
for you&mdash;is there no other way?"
</p>

<p>
"There is no other way, my son,"
returned Radisson gravely.
</p>

<p>
"Then let us go forth and seek what
may betide," I answered bitterly.
</p>

<p>
There was no time lost.  Our few
belongings were all ready, and we set out
after Radisson who followed in the steps
of the Keeper.  As for the Arrow, he
melted into the bushes and was gone&mdash;to
scout for danger and to meet us at the
canoes, explained the old wanderer.
</p>

<p>
That march through the forest was one
of no little hardship for all of us, but more
especially for Ruth and me.  There was
danger all about us, for at any moment
we might come upon parties of Chippewas
who were even then searching the forest
for trace of us.  I walked along as one
in a maze, and in truth my poor brain
was all bewildered.
</p>

<p>
What was the meaning of this strange
meeting with the two Mohawks?  And
Radisson's words to them&mdash;was Ruth
indeed his niece?  That was hardly to be
credited, methought, for why had he said
no word to us before?  And in any case,
he could know no more of the maid than
did I, who had lived all my life beside her.
None the less, the matter troubled me.
</p>

<p>
In point of distance we had not far to go,
but the difficulties of the savage forest
beset us sorely.  Ruth had much ado to
prevent her skirts being torn by thorns and
jagged branches.  At one time we would
be pushing through thick-grown saplings,
and at another leaping from tussock to
tussock of swamp-grass.  The Keeper and
Radisson, better accustomed to such places,
moved like shadows; but had there been
any foe near, my crashing must have
betrayed our presence beyond a doubt.
</p>

<p>
Yet all things draw to an end, and the
end of our journey was a clear, open lake
of good size.  Not a hundred yards from
where we emerged, The Arrow stood waiting
beside the shore, and at his feet were
two canoes.  Here was a new wonder to
me, that the Keeper should have guided us
so surely through those trackless woods
to the side of his comrade.
</p>

<p>
But Ruth was fain for rest, and so was
I.  We sank down beside the canoes, and
here Radisson joined us.
</p>

<p>
"Now," he said with a certain vigor
and spring in his voice which was new to
me, "I will explain things to you, my
children.  In the first place, you are verily
my sister's daughter, Ruth.  It was nigh
twenty years ago that I left her in
Montreal, new-married to the Sieur de
Courbelles, and my last gift to her was
that brooch you wear at your throat.
See&mdash;those are mine own arms upon it!
Then I left New France, but she, with
her husband, was to join me in London
town.  I never heard word of her again,
my child; there can be no doubt that their
ship was driven far north and you alone
were saved."
</p>

<p>
He paused a space, and I saw that
Ruth's own little fingers had stolen out
to grasp his.  But here there came a great
light to me.
</p>

<p>
"Then," I exclaimed, "was that why
Gib o' Clarclach was so hasty after Ruth?
Nay, but it could hardly have been so, for
he had scarce recognized that little
brooch!"
</p>

<p>
"Not that, David," smiled the old man,
"but he knew the arms right well, and
doubtless he also knew the tale of my
sister and her loss by shipwreck.  I must
tell you, lad, that the man who you know
as Gib, whom I know as Jean Lareatt,
whom the Indians hereabouts know to
their cost as The Pike, is an agent of
France&mdash;a spy, who serves France or
England according as he is best paid.  No
one knows, or ever will know, just who
his masters are.  So you see, lad, that if
he could lay hold on the maid and fetch
her to Paris, they might get me into their
clutches again right easily."
</p>

<p>
"But not that!" I exclaimed angrily.
"Frenchmen would never dare go to such
extremes with a maid of good birth&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Radisson's face went black.  "No?
Wait till you know them as I do, the
Jesuit dogs!  If you want the truth of it,
that man Gib is no man of France so
much as he is a paid spy of the Order&mdash;the
Order that has hounded me, stolen the
credit of discoveries, sent forth its men
in my place to gain mine honor, and at the
last tried to steal this child of my blood!"
</p>

<p>
And therewith he went on to tell me
things I had not dreamed possible.  He
told of his long trips through the
wilderness, of how he had found the "Father
of Waters," how his reports had been
stolen and altered, his furs stolen from
him, and how on the strength of his labors
the Jesuits had sent out men of their order
to take the credit for his work.
</p>

<p>
"But why?" asked Ruth with wondering
eyes.  "Why should they do this
thing?  Surely there are honorable and
good men among&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Aye, lass, there are," Radisson made
quick response.  "But the reason for it is
simply that I am none of their faith.
When a lad I was taken by the Mohawks
and grew up among them.  Then I
returned to mine own people, but I never
forgot my adopted nation.  On all my trips
I carried Iroquois with me.  The Arrow
here went to the Detroit with me years
before the settlement was founded there.
The Keeper was behind me when the
Sioux people saw their first white face,
and when I was led to the great river in
the South."
</p>

<p>
With that our conversation was ended,
for The Arrow approached and warned us
that the day was drawing on apace.  We
made a light meal off some dried venison,
after which we embarked in the canoes.
In one went The Arrow, Ruth and I, while
The Keeper and Radisson embarked in the
other, and we followed in their course
across the lake to the mouth of a little
river that flowed westward.
</p>

<p>
So it came about that I set my back
toward my own people.  I sat in the bow,
The Arrow in the stern.  Whiles we
paddled, and whiles floated where the river
was more rapid, but Ruth talked ever with
us.  I could hear her chattering with the
stolid man in the stern, who seemed to
waken into life at her words, and so we
gained some knowledge of these two
strange Indians and their ways.
</p>

<p>
Of the Iroquois confederacy Radisson
had already told us much, and of their
Long House, which was not unlike the
Houses of Parliament in London town.
Here the Five Nations sent their delegates
to make laws and give judgments, and the
highest chief of each nation kept the doors.
The Mohawks, who lived farther east than
the rest, held the eastern door of that
savage parliament, which fact had given
the Black Prince his title.  I wondered at
his name being the same as that of a
former prince of England, but the reason
therefor I never knew.
</p>

<p>
As we wended on our way my gloom
began to drop from me.  I realized how
Radisson felt, and the fact that before us
lay a great new land where no white man
was, thrilled me to the marrow.  I drew
the good free air deep into my lungs and
put away all thought of that villain Gib o'
Clarclach; all these plottings were left
behind us, and only the open country and
friends lay before.  What if these friends
were red?  From the talk of The Arrow,
red friends were as good as or better than
white.
</p>

<p>
Since then I have realized more truly
just what that terrible journey from the
Canadas had meant for the two Mohawks.
Alone and unaided they had traversed a
wilderness of foes to find the man they loved
as brother.  When they came to the Cree
people they chanced upon traces of him,
Radisson being well known to the Crees,
and for his sake the strangers had been
taken in and provided for.  Their prowess
soon made them great men among the
Crees, whose customs were not so very
different, though less bloody; and during
the two years they had spent, waiting for
Radisson with a firm faith in his coming,
their position had been firmly established.
All these things came to me not at once,
but slowly, during the many days we
paddled on, heading toward the west, and then
to the north.  Our way was slow, because
on the third day one of the canoes was
ripped on a rock and we had to wait for
a hasty patching.  The weather was very
warm indeed, but cold at night.
</p>

<p>
So it came about that when pursuit had
been left far behind, we were in the
Barren Places, as The Keeper named them.
And they deserved the name, being of
swamp and scrub trees and thickets of
saplings; but of game there was plenty.
In this place came the danger to Ruth, and
here we first encountered the Mighty One,
of whom I will have great things to tell in
their own place.
</p>

<p>
One morning Ruth and I had left the
camp for an early ramble.  I took a fusil,
thinking to kill a deer or caribou.  We
climbed a little hill above the camp and
entered the thicker woods, where after a
while we became separated, Ruth halting
beside some bushes of berries, very good to
the taste.  I was perhaps a hundred yards
from her when I heard a sudden cry.
</p>

<p>
Whirling about, I saw a wondrous beast
plunging toward the lass.  Of monstrous
build he was, with huge shoulders and head,
while great splay-horns added to his frightful
mien.  In terror, Ruth made shift to
get behind a tree, while the monster stood
shaking his head and striking the earth
with his hoofs.
</p>

<p>
I had been so startled that for a
moment I forgot my fusil.  Never had I
dreamed of so huge a beast!  I shouted
at him and ran forward, whereat he came
at me speedily.  Ruth cried out again, and
in mighty fear I raised my weapon, thinking
to see fire come from his nostrils at
any moment, for I took him as little less
than the fiend himself.
</p>

<p>
But now he had turned again to Ruth,
and the little maid was barely keeping the
tree between them.  In desperation, I
poured fresh powder in the pan and aimed
again.  This time the weapon spoke, and
the added powder sent me backward to
the ground with the recoil.  Those mighty
horns seemed to shoot forward and up,
the huge body rose in air, and the next
I knew was that the terrible beast was
standing over me, scraping at me with
his horns.  Fortunately, they seemed soft,
like those of a deer in summer, and I beat
frantically at his enormous nose.  An
instant later I gripped the horns.
</p>

<p>
With this, the monster lifted his head
and me with it.  I gave myself up for
lost as he pressed me back into a tree,
snorting and grunting, but I hung on
grimly enough, for I feared the sharp
hoofs.
</p>

<p>
"Run!" I cried to Ruth, whom I could
not see.  "Run, Ruth!"
</p>

<p>
I felt my strength going fast.  Now the
beast had pushed me in through the
branches and was striving to grind me
against the tree-trunk itself.  Vainly did
I writhe and twist away, for those huge
horns swung and slashed at me, and had
they been hard I had died in that moment.
As it was, I felt my ribs crushed in, then a
terrific pain shot through me, and my grip
loosened.
</p>

<p>
But even as I fell back, a wild yell
sounded in my ears, and a blast of
powder-smoke swept by my face.  The massy
horns were gone, and I scraped back
against the tree and came to the ground,
helpless and broken.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XI.
<br /><br />
IN THE VILLAGES OF THE CREES.
</h3>

<p>
What happened after that was of
little interest to me.  I have brief,
fitful memories of things that occurred
at intervals, for as I later learned
from Ruth, my hurts were very sore
indeed, and more than once they had given
me up for dead.  But for The Keeper and
for Radisson himself, who searched through
the woods for healing simples and herbs
at each camping-place, I had been in sorry
plight.
</p>

<p>
I mind me of many days of travel, during
no small part of which I was lashed tightly
enough to the canoe.  At times Ruth's face
would be above me, her fingers sweeping
my brow, and at times Radisson's kindly
white beard would bend over me and his
fingers, for all their sinewy strength, were
as tender as those of Ruth.
</p>

<p>
That was a dour and terrible journey.
Even now, as I sit writing and gazing
over the moors that roll upland beyond
Ayrby, I can feel the throbs of pain across
my ribs, and the hurt of the thwart against
my back.  And in the damp weather the
feeling is no mere imagination, either.
</p>

<p>
I remember, after many days of flickering
lights and shadows, there came one
time when Ruth's tears fell on my cheeks
and irritated me strangely.  Perhaps the
lass did not know I was conscious, for
I could speak no word.  I heard Radisson
attempt to cheer her, and it seemed that
he, too, had lost his heartiness.  Then
they died away into blackness once more,
and the next memory is of the Crees.
</p>

<p>
Queer men they were, queer people,
moving like the veriest devils through my
half-sensed dreams, although they were
our firmest friends.  Radisson to them was
a deity, and the two Mohawks were little
less.  They were great hunters and
fighters, however, and when my mind came
back to me somewhat I never lacked for
meat and broth, while skins of the richest
were ours in plenty.
</p>

<p>
When I came to learn of the journey,
after I had been injured, it was a tale
of hardship and suffering&mdash;incurred for
the most part on my account.  To move
a helpless man across the wilderness is a
task for the mightiest, and our little party
had been sore put to it ere a party of
the Crees found us and aided us to their
villages.
</p>

<p>
I came to my clear senses one day, at
last, to find a great weight lying upon me,
and all dark around.  I put up my hand
to remove the weight and found that it
was the skin of some beast, yet I could
not so much as lift it.  By this I knew
I must be very sick and weak, and for a
space the knowledge frighted me oddly.
</p>

<p>
Suddenly light appeared to one side, and
I saw I was lying in a conical shelter, like
a tent, and that Ruth stood in the doorway.
I called to her weakly enough.
</p>

<p>
"Eh, lassie!  Come and help me."
</p>

<p>
She gave a little cry and dropped on
her knees at my side.  But she would not
take the fur away, whereat I wondered.
Nor would she let me talk, but told me
of the journey and of where we now were.
</p>

<p>
To my utter amazement I found that I
had been sick, not for days, but for long
weeks.  It was a good month and more
that I had lain in this shelter, in the Cree
village, and near two months since we
had met the moose.  The first snow had
come upon the land, and the days and
nights were bitter cold.
</p>

<p>
In the lodge next to mine dwelt Ruth,
and beyond that Radisson and the
Mohawks.  There was a tale to be told of
great wonders, of things and beasts and
men such as we had never dreamed of in
the old days at Ayrby farm.  I listened
half-believing, and before she had finished
dropped into a deep, pleasant sleep.
</p>

<p>
Through the days that followed I began
to adjust myself somewhat to the new
life about me.  The Crees&mdash;dark, dirty
men who wore skins&mdash;were kind enough
and treated me with not only respect but
even deference.  For some time I was at
a loss to account for this.  I presently
came to understand that I was looked upon
as a great man, greater even than the two
Mohawks, which surprised me and troubled
me no little.  It is not right and just
that a man should be so treated by his
fellows unless he has proved himself greater
than they, and the worship of these poor
heathen creatures worried me mightily.
</p>

<p>
Radisson spent long hours with me,
talking and explaining the things all around.
Our fusils he had carefully oiled and laid
aside, for it seemed that the Crees had
never heard the sound of a gun, and the
time might come when an appeal to their
superstition would do wonders.
</p>

<p>
"But is that right?" I asked doubtfully.
"Methinks it would be more Christian in
us to help the poor creatures to understand,
than to try and shock them into thinking
us men of another world."
</p>

<p>
"Why, so we are," smiled Radisson.
"You see, Davie, we are like to be safe
for the present, until the deep snows come.
Then we can look for trouble.  I have
sent out runners to the east and south, for
it seems to me that the English around
the Bay will not rest until they get news of
me.  The Chippewa nation is always warring
against the Crees, and like enough
The Pike will lead them.  Our friend is
a subtle, crafty fellow and will halt at
nothing.
</p>

<p>
"As for your fears in the matter of
religion, Davie, you had best forget them.
We can live down to their standard, as
does The Pike, or up to our standard, as
I have ever done.  I have no great wish to
preach to them, for their faith is good
enough, but do you suit yourself in that
regard.  It may be that God has not brought
us here for nothing, and it is far from my
thought to thwart His will."
</p>

<p>
As the time went by I grew stronger,
walking about the village on the arm of
Ruth and coming to understand more and
more the people among whom we were.
Having little else to do, I took to learning
their tongue from a chief named Uchichak,
or The Crane.  He was a fine, upright,
silent man of good parts, and as I came to
speak the language a little, I told him of
the true God.  But at this he would ever
fall silent, gazing into the fire and saying
no word, so that I deemed my talk but
wasted.
</p>

<p>
The Keeper and The Arrow were but
indifferent Christians, having been converted
years before by the French, and their faith
was a mixture of heathenism and religion
which was strange to see.  Once I protested
with The Keeper about taking scalps,
whereat he silenced me deftly and firmly.
</p>

<p>
"Brave Eyes"&mdash;for such was the name
I now bore&mdash;"does not know of what he
speaks.  Here the nations do not war as
our nation wars.  The Great Spirit has
whispered to me that it is right for the
white men to do some things, and wrong
for the red men to do some things.  He has
whispered to Uchichak that it is not right
for the Crees to take scalps, and they do
not.  He has whispered to The Keeper that
it is right, and so The Keeper does.  He
has whispered to the white men that they
shall drink of the water of fire.  He has
whispered to The Keeper not to drink.  The
Keeper has seen his brothers disobey, and
drink, until their minds were stolen from
their bodies.  The Keeper does not disobey
the Great Spirit.  Let my brother listen to
the Great Spirit, unless he thinks himself
greater.  Does my brother know more than
the Great Spirit?"
</p>

<p>
It was the longest speech I ever heard
from The Keeper, and his quiet sarcasm at
the close taught me a lesson that I sorely
needed.  I had considered myself above
these poor heathen people, and in time I
came to know that in many ways I was
below them.  We did not worship alike,
yet we all worshiped.  There was much
that they could and did teach me, and
Uchichak came to be a very good friend
to me.
</p>

<p>
The two Mohawks came to rather disregard
me and Ruth, centering themselves
on Radisson alone, quietly but insistently.
They hunted and fished with him, or alone,
and left me to Uchichak, who proved an
able teacher.  Those were happy weeks for
me, as I slowly came back to strength and
health, and I believe that never in her life
had Ruth been so filled with the joy of
youth as she was here.  And it was well,
for there were dark days to come.
</p>

<p>
As to our future, that was unsettled.
Radisson was filled with a great dream of
going on into the sunset and searching out
the country there, of finding lands where
no white man had ever trod.  His age was
as nothing to him, and I verily believe that
except for Ruth he had departed long since.
But the love of the little maid restrained
him, and his great vision waited on her
will.
</p>

<p>
With the snows, I set forth on the heels
of Uchichak, learning to hunt and fish and
trap as did the Crees.  Our fusils and
little store of powder were jealously guarded
away, so that perforce I had to learn the
bow and spear.  I learned that moose and
elk and bison were no creatures from the
nether world, but animals of flesh and
blood, and one day I proposed to The
Crane that we should seek out the moose
who had attacked us, and who had so nearly
killed me.  At the suggestion a strange
expression swept across the chief's dark,
handsome face, and he glanced at me with
a worried look.
</p>

<p>
"Is my brother so anxious to meet the
Great Spirit?  Has he not escaped the
horns of the Mighty One by a miracle?"
</p>

<p>
"Nonsense!" I retorted.  "The Great
Spirit did not give me the heart of a
coward, Uchichak.  He saved me from the
moose, and if it be His will, I shall some
day meet and slay the animal.  Why do
you call him the Mighty One?"
</p>

<p>
It seemed to me that The Crane fell to
trembling, almost.  Certainly his face
quivered, and he glanced around uneasily.
We stood alone, our snowshoes leaving a
faint trail across a bare rise of snow,
carrying a small deer between us.  The
chief set down his end of the pole and
faced me.
</p>

<p>
"You have said many things to me
that I do not understand, my brother.  You
have told me of the Great Spirit whom
you serve, and sometimes I have thought
that He was our own Great Spirit also.
You have told me how He came to your
people and let men kill Him, which to me
seemed very foolish, so that I knew He
was not the same Great Spirit."
</p>

<p>
In that moment I saw the mistake I had
made.  I had told Uchichak the bare story
of the Gospels, but had not explained that
story.  There, standing in the snow beside
the stiff and frozen deer, with his intent
gaze fixed on me, I spoke as best I might.
Indeed, the words seemed to come to me
as if placed in my mouth, and when I had
made an end I knew not what I had said.
</p>

<p>
But Uchichak gazed at me silently, and
I think that he had understood the greater
part of my speech, for I had spoken mostly
in his own tongue, haltingly but simply
enough that a child might understand.
</p>

<p>
"You have spoken well, my brother,"
he returned slowly.  "I have understood
your words, although your speech is harsh,
and it seemed to me that not you were
speaking, but the Great Spirit whom you
worship.  Listen.  It is well that my
people should hear of this also.  We are not
like the Sioux or the Chippewas, blind to
all things.  We are eager to let our ears
be open, and our old men are very wise.
To-morrow night shall a Council be held,
and before the Council you shall tell these
things."
</p>

<p>
Without pausing for answer, he stooped
and we picked up the deer.  Our way
home was silent enough, and I dared to
dream that I had impressed The Crane
with some knowledge of the true God.  But
this was far from the case, as I was to
learn.
</p>

<p>
I have passed over lightly my days of
striving, when I was learning to live this
new life, for of late my fingers have grown
somewhat stiff and the quill hard to hold,
and I have that to tell of which must not
be delayed.  At this time the winter was
well onward, and many of the men were
away from the village, hunting in the
Barren Places.  Of Gib and his Chippewas
we had heard nothing.
</p>

<p>
Grim, all this time, had remained close
to me and Ruth.  The Indian dogs, used
for hauling sleds in winter, seemed idle,
frivolous creatures to him, and he disdained
to give them attention.  The Crees were
inclined to sneer at him as a "lodge-dog,"
good for nothing except to lie beside the
fire, until one day two of their fighting
brutes went for him.  Grim, forced to the
combat, made such short work of the wolf-like
beasts that thereafter the others slunk
past him in fear, while the Crees also gave
him a wide berth.
</p>

<p>
Upon reaching the village that night, we
found that Radisson and the Mohawks had
left for a two-day elk hunt.  A little
dismayed at their absence, I sought out Ruth
and told her of my conversation with the
chief.
</p>

<p>
"We will face them together, Davie," she
said softly, her deep eyes aglow.  "A
woman is not admitted to the council, yet
Uchichak can persuade them easily enough.
They are not stern, fierce people like the
Mohawks, and they will listen to me."
</p>

<p>
Gladly enough I asked Uchichak.  After
a moment he nodded gravely.
</p>

<p>
"She may speak, and then go.  It is not
permitted that women should sit in the
council."
</p>

<p>
This was the best I could get out of him,
but it was enough.  There was no sign
of Radisson the next afternoon, and as the
council-lodge was made ready I began to
miss his support.  Ruth and I knew that
we would have no great ordeal before us,
but it would be hard indeed to break
through the stolidity of the Crees, to
appeal to their finer feelings.  That they or
other Indians have such feelings has been
denied; but I, who have lived and hunted
with them, know that all men have souls
alike&mdash;mayhap some deeper-buried than
others beneath the crust of time and
circumstance, yet all there for the finding.
</p>

<p>
Ruth and I ate our evening meal
together, while Grim crunched a bone
contentedly at our sides.  Both of us, as our
garments had given out, had replaced
them with others of very soft skin, while
in this cold winter weather we wore furs
as did the Crees.  When the meal was
done we covered over the little fire in the
center of the lodge, and stepped to the
door.
</p>

<p>
Five minutes later we were in the lodge
of council&mdash;a large structure, half skin and
half brush.  Around the fire were ranged
the old men of the village, and the chiefs;
and after a dignified silence the calumet
was passed around from hand to hand,
among the very old men only, for with
these people tobacco was rather in the
nature of a burnt-offering, and was never
smoked for the pleasure therein.  Another
silence, then the oldest chief arose and
very briefly directed Ruth to speak to them
as she wished.
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><a id="chap12"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XII.
<br /><br />
THE MOOSE OF MYSTERY.
</h3>

<p>
I would that I might give here the
speech that Ruth made to those Crees,
there by the dim light of the little fire,
her yellow hair flashing forth from the
wolf-fur hood in long tendrils, her eyes
striving to pierce through the darkness to
those stolid faces about her.  She did not
speak their language at all well, and I saw
plainly that the hearing had been given her
out of courtesy alone.  They were our
friends, were these Crees, because we were
the friends of Radisson, and they would do
all for us that friends might.
</p>

<p>
At length she finished and turned away.
I stepped forward when the old chief had
gravely risen and thanked her, and led her
to the entrance.  When I returned, the
same old man rose and addressed me.
</p>

<p>
"Our brother Brave Eyes has heard the
words of the Yellow Lily.  They were like
the dew upon the trees at dawn&mdash;sparkling
and refreshing, but not fit to quench
the thirst of the warriors.  There is much
that we do not understand, and we hope
that Brave Eyes will set our minds at rest."
</p>

<p>
I waited a space, knowing that this
would add dignity to my words.  Even as
I rose to my feet, a noise of dogs came
from without, the flap of the door was
pushed aside and The Keeper, The Arrow
and Radisson entered and flitted to their
seats in the Council.  This seemed like a
good omen to me, and I took heart again.
</p>

<p>
Now I appealed to the warriors direct,
strove to wake them to consciousness of
what my message meant, applied all that I
said to their life and daily acts.  As I went
on, the words flowed almost of themselves,
and I, who had ever been a clumsy, gawky
lout, felt with a thrill that I was commanding
these men.  Yet it was not I, as none
knew better.  It was a Something that
spoke in and through me, until in the end
I felt a great fear of what that Something
might be.  None the less, I said what I
had to say, and so seated myself again,
the sweat standing out on my brow.
</p>

<p>
For a long, long time there was no
sound within the lodge.  Then I saw The
Keeper rise to his feet and walk out beside
the fire, standing a moment like a dark
statue.
</p>

<p>
"My brothers," he said in Cree, "we
have listened to very great words.  In my
own land the Great Spirit has sent his
Blackrobes to speak such words to us, and
we have listened.  I am very old, my
brothers.  These words are sweet in my
ears.  But my white brothers, Brave Eyes
and White Eagle, have not heard all.  The
Great Spirit has not whispered to them of
the Mighty One.  Perhaps he has sent
them that the Mighty One should be slain,
and that the Cree nation should know
which was the True Great Spirit.  I have
ended."
</p>

<p>
I did not understand the conclusion of
this speech, but I did understand the
half-audible gasp of horror that ran through
the lodge.  It brought back to me the time
when I was a little fellow, and had gone
to meeting one day with my father and
mother.  While the preacher was thundering
forth, I had escaped from mother and
toddled away to look up in laughing wonder
at the tall figure of Alec Gordon, with
his stiff starched bands.  In that moment
the same shuddering gasp had echoed
through the folk, and I heard later that no
few of them had looked to see me fall
stricken.
</p>

<p>
So around the Council lodge ran the
same whisper and was gone instantly.  I
wondered what sacrilege The Keeper had
uttered, and stared at Uchichak as he
gravely rose, took up the calumet, lit it,
and waved it to the four corners of the
heavens.  Then he replaced it and turned
toward me.
</p>

<p>
"My brother Ta-cha-noon-tia is our
friend.  His words are the words of a
friend.  He is a great warrior and an old
man, and his Great Spirit is very strong.
But it is not our Great Spirit who whispers
in his ear, and we are afraid.  I will
tell my brothers of our Great Spirit."
</p>

<p>
With a single stride he went to the door
and flung open the flap dramatically.
Before us in the sky flamed the northern
lights&mdash;grotesque sheeted figures of
lambent flame, dancing here and yon, rising,
falling, many-colored.
</p>

<p>
"The Spirits of the Dead who Dance,"
he affirmed, in a single Cree word.  "My
brothers the Great Spirit of our fathers
is mighty.  This is his sign to his children.
When we have passed the last trail, we too
shall join our fathers in the Spirit-dance
across the heavens.  This is the sign that
our Great Spirit has given us.  And now
I shall tell you of the Mystery."
</p>

<p>
I would have sprung up and made ready
answer, but a hand gripped my arm and I
found Radisson behind me.  I remembered
that Indian ways were not our ways, and
that when Uchichak had finished I could
speak, and not until then.
</p>

<p>
"My brothers, our Great Spirit, from
the days of our fathers, has sent us a
messenger.  Sometimes it is a man, sometimes
it is an animal."  His voice lowered almost
to a whisper, and the hush was intense.
"My brothers, it is more than an animal,
more than a little brother of the forest.
We who are chiefs, we of the Council,
know that this messenger is none other
than the Great Spirit himself, who comes
to watch over his children."
</p>

<p>
For an instant there was dead silence,
Uchichak standing with bowed head.  Only
the sound of heavy breathing filled the
lodge until he continued more firmly.
</p>

<p>
"My brothers, when I was very young
the messenger was a White Beaver, larger
and more cunning than ever beaver was
before him.  When I was a young man the
Mighty One had vanished, and in his place
was another Mighty One.  How did we
know this?  I will tell you.
</p>

<p>
"One of our young men brought the
news that in the Barren Places was a
mighty moose, larger than any moose ever
seen.  He had followed the tracks, and had
come to a bear, slain by the moose.  There
were three young men in the village who
said they would hunt this moose.  Our old
men warned them, saying that the young
man had been led to the bear in token that
the moose wished us well.  Perhaps he was
a Mighty One.  But the young men refused
to listen and went forth with their dogs.
</p>

<p>
"My brothers, you have heard the tale
of Spotted Lynx, Two Horns and Yellow
Cloud.  They hunted for many weeks.  The
Mighty One did not wish to harm them.
But at last they found him feeding, and
wounded him.  My brothers, are any of
those young men among you?  Have you
seen their faces in the lodges of their
people?  Have they returned to their fathers?"
</p>

<p>
A single half-suppressed groan broke
from one of the old men.  There was no
doubt that the tale was true.  I reflected that
if three hunters, armed with bow and spear,
had gone out against that terrible moose,
there might well have been small chance
of their returning safe.  But The Crane
did not pause long.
</p>

<p>
"We have heard how the hunters of
the Chippewa nation have sought him, and
have fled home like women to their people.
Our fathers have told us how, when
they were little children, the Great Spirit
had whispered to them that the Crees
should not seek to hunt the Mighty One,
and should not seek to hunt in the hills of
the Barren Places.  It is in these hills that
the Mighty One now dwells, and the
Chippewas fear them also.
</p>

<p>
"Sometimes the Mighty One travels far.
My brothers, you have heard how Brave
Eyes met him.  You have seen that he
favored Brave Eyes and did not kill him,
but sent him to be our brother.  The heart
of Brave Eyes is very strong.  We know
that it holds no fear.  Now that he knows
who the Mighty One is whose horns he felt,
now that he knows it was our Great Spirit
himself, Brave Eyes will not fear to say
that he was wrong."
</p>

<p>
Uchichak drew his furs about him and
resumed his seat.  The eyes of the
Council, one by one, were slowly turned on
me.  But not until I felt Radisson's hand
relax on my arm did I rise to speak.
</p>

<p>
"My brothers," I said with some difficulty,
"I speak in a strange tongue.  I can
find no words in it to say that I did not
speak to you rightly before.  The Crane
has told me that the Spirits of the Dead
who Dance are signs from your Great
Spirit.  How is it, then, that the same
signs have come to me and my brother the
White Eagle and to my sister the Yellow
Lily, very far from here.  How is it that
this sign comes to my white brothers also?"
</p>

<p>
There was a little stir at this, and I
heard the Keeper grunt in appreciation.
</p>

<p>
"Listen, my brothers.  I have told you
of the sign in the water, which the Great
Spirit has sent to his white children,
through his own Son.  I wish you to
remember this, and it may be that you will
accept this sign.  As to your Mighty One,
he is not a Messenger sent by the Great
Spirit; he is a messenger of the Evil
Spirit."
</p>

<p>
I had looked for another stir at these
words, but none came.  Instead, there was
silence&mdash;the silence of apprehension, of
waiting.
</p>

<p>
"My brothers, you do not like my words,
but your hearts are open.  Your ears are
not closed to the whisper of the Great
Spirit, and you will listen.  If the Mighty
One was your friend and protector, would
he have slain your young men?  Would
he not have sent them home as he has sent
the other hunters, like foolish women?"
</p>

<p>
I paused again, taking full advantage of
this favorite trick of Indian Oratory.
</p>

<p>
"Listen, my brothers.  My Great Spirit
whispers to me.  He says that your Mighty
One is false.  He says that there is only
one Great Spirit, and that He wishes you
to accept the sign in the water.  He says
that it is for this purpose He brought me
to you.  He asks you whether you will
accept this sign that you believe in Him."
</p>

<p>
With this rather abrupt close I sat down.
There was a long silence as they turned
over my words carefully, slowly, weighing
each one.  Finally the old wizened
head-chief, whose single eagle-feather gleamed
oddly in the red light, answered me.
</p>

<p>
"My brother, you have spoken well.
Your words have satisfied the thirst of
the warriors, as the spring that bubbles in
the forest.  Yet we were afraid at them,
for we feared that our Great Spirit would
be angry.
</p>

<p>
"You have said that the sign of the
Spirits of the Dead has been sent to you
also.  That is well.  The Great Spirit has
whispered to me.  He whispered in my
ear that you, my brother, and my brother
White Eagle also, should prove to us that
the Mighty One is a messenger of the Evil
Spirit.  You have told us how your Great
Spirit sent His Son to you, and how you
killed Him.  We would not have treated
Him thus, my brother.  Our ears are open.
We would have feasted Him with venison
and listened to Him.
</p>

<p>
"The Great Spirit has whispered to me
that you should seek the Mighty One.  We
know that there is no fear in your heart,
and that the White Eagle is very wise and
good.  Perhaps the Great Spirit will help
you.  If you slay the Mighty One we will
know that we have been wrong, and that
our fathers have been wrong, and we will
accept the sign in the water."
</p>

<p>
Weak and shaking, the old man sat
down and covered his face.  One by one
the chiefs stood up and spoke in the same
vein.  One by one they agreed that if
Radisson and I should slay the Moose,
they would accept the "sign in the water,"
for thus only could I represent the symbol
of baptism to them.  Uchichak made a
splendid speech, and I was right glad to
find here in the wilderness men whose
minds were so open, so free to conviction.
Their beliefs were simple and earnest, and
while there was small hope that they would
or could accept the gospel of peace, merely
to bring them to a knowledge of the True
God would be a tremendous conquest.
</p>

<p>
So the Council ended.  Radisson
accompanied me to the lodge of Ruth, where
we told her all that had taken place, and
of the gage of battle which had been flung
before us.  That it would be accepted by
Radisson I had no doubt.
</p>

<p>
"Aye, lad," he said in answer to my
eager question, "I may hold to no faith
over-much, but in this matter I am with
you&mdash;if only for the sake of little Ruth
here."
</p>

<p>
"Not that!" she flashed out at him
quickly.  "Pray, Uncle Pierre, have you
no deeper thought than this?  Look deep
down in your heart, and say no if you
dare!"
</p>

<p>
Radisson looked down at her, then at
me, and in his weary eyes I saw what I
had but seldom found in his face.  In that
moment I knew that even from us he had
kept his real self hidden.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, child," he replied softly.  "I
hesitated to acknowledge it, but it is true.  I
may not be of your faith, but I will do
this thing for the sake of Him who suffered
for us all, and in the trust that through
us these poor, faithful friends of ours may
be given a light to lighten their darkness."
</p>

<p>
Wherewith he rose and left us suddenly,
nor did he ever allude to that conversation
again, until the day he left us.  But Ruth
and I sat silent for a little space, wondering.
</p>

<p>
"It is a fearsome thing," I murmured
at last, "how this superstition has laid hold
on such men as Uchichak.  Why, the
Mighty One is no more than a beast&mdash;cunning,
merciless, but still a beast.  With
such men as Radisson and the Mohawks
with me, what is there to fear?"
</p>

<p>
"Softly, Davie," smiled Ruth a little
sadly.  "It is not so easy as may seem to
you.  Did ever an easy thing accomplish
aught in the world?  It is the things we
fight for and suffer for that are worth
while, that bring the Word to the world.
It was never God's way to make the path
easy for those who bear His Word."
</p>

<p>
I wondered at her not a little.  There
was a light in her sweet face that I had
never seen before, and something in her
manner smote me to the heart, so that I
bade her good-night and left her to sleep.
</p>

<p>
And ever since that night I have thought
that Ruth spoke not of herself, for her
words were fraught with prophecy.
</p>

<p>
For the next few days the four of us
were very busy.  We decided that if the
work must be done it should be done at
once, and we made ready without delay.
I think Radisson, despite his words of that
night, was eager to be off and away into
the westing lands where no man had been,
for it was ever his wont to seek beyond
the known things.
</p>

<p>
The Crees were ready enough to help
us with all that we asked.  Uchichak it was
who gave us his dogs and sled, whereon
we loaded food and our fusils, with what
store of powder and ball we had.  It was
settled that after the next heavy fall of
snow we should set forth, and by the signs
of the country the Crees declared that a
storm was not far off.
</p>

<p>
Indeed, it came within the week&mdash;two
days of heavy, drifting snow and high wind.
And when it came we knew that ere long
we would be parted from our little lass.
But the manner of that parting, and the
ending of it, was in no wise what we had
looked forward to.

<h3>
CHAPTER XIII.
<br /><br />
THE RAIDERS.
</h3>

<p>
Now it may be that the things I have
to relate will seem strange and
un-Christian and wondrous, even as they
do to me.  Yet are they but the truth.  In
that far Northern land many such things
come to pass, for there man is very close
to the forces of the world, and whether
it be that his mind is quickened by the dread
silence of the snows, or whether there is
in truth a nearness to God in that silence,
I know not.  It has often vexed me and
the answer is not yet.
</p>

<p>
But this much I do know.  Holding to
none of the superstitions around me, I then
believed and do still affirm that the whole
matter of the Moose of Mystery, the
Mighty One, was under the direction of
some Higher Power, and that Gib o'
Clarclach came to his triumph and his
end through that same guidance.  Howbeit,
I had best leave you to judge for
yourselves.
</p>

<p>
That storm came upon us and closed us
in our lodges for two days.  On the third
morning it was decided that we should
start forth just as soon as the crust had
formed strong enough to bear dogs and
sled.  In the meantime, Uchichak and I
went forth upon a last hunt, thinking to
bring in a caribou or elk, for with the
winter the bison had drifted far to the
south of us.
</p>

<p>
Two days of idleness and gorging, as
was the custom of the Crees, had well-nigh
finished the stock of food in the village.
Therefore most of the men fared
forth on the hunt.  Radisson and the two
Mohawks trailed together, admitting none
other to their company, and on the second
morning thereafter we four were to set out
upon our quest.  According to custom, the
warriors set out in small groups or singly,
scattering in all directions.  Ruth was
engaged in making deerskin scabbards for the
fusils, since in that terrific cold it was
impossible to set fingers to iron.
</p>

<p>
Uchichak and I were accompanied by
a lively young brave named Wapistan, or
The Marten, who had often gone out with
us, and whose tracking powers were
remarkable.  As ever, we were armed only
with bows and flint-tipped arrows.  My
own weapon, which I had made with great
care, was a source of great interest to the
Crees, for it was full twice as long and
thick as theirs, and even Uchichak could
scarcely bend it, although to me the trick
came easily enough.  I would never be as
expert as was The Crane, but when it
came to distance I could overshoot him
greatly.  This, however, was more by
reason of my greater strength, for which
quality of body I later thanked God most
heartily.
</p>

<p>
The fierceness of the storm seemed to
have driven most of the larger animals to
the shelter of the hills, and although we
circled widely to the cast of the village
and then to the north, by that evening we
had found nothing save a few rabbits, which
barely were sufficient for our own needs.
As there was another day ahead of us, we
camped that night beneath some willows
on the bank of an ice-clad river.  I urged
Uchichak to push forward to the hills in
the northeast, but he refused stoutly.
</p>

<p>
"Those are the Ghost Hills, brother.
There walks the Mighty One, and the
Spirits of the Dead who Dance.  We can
hear them singing in the wind.  We must
not disturb them."
</p>

<p>
All that evening The Crane was very
silent and downcast, and I came to know
that he considered that this was our last
trip together.  To his mind, the Great
Spirit would never allow me to come back
from that hunt against the Mighty One.
The Ghost Hills were sacred, and were
about to be impiously profaned.  Indeed,
since that meeting of the Council we had
come in for no small share of reverence
from all the warriors, who held that we
were bravely going to our deaths.  I
learned later that it had been decided that
the Yellow Lily should become the adopted
daughter of the tribe, should we fail to
return.
</p>

<p>
Early in the morning the three of us left
our brush shelter and started forth,
determined to avoid the disgrace of returning
to the village empty-handed.  Now we
circled back toward the south again,
overlooking no patch of woods where elk or
deer might be sheltering.  The morning
was still young when we came to a break
of heavy-laden pines, and started through
them warily.  Suddenly a cry from
Wapistan, at one side, called us to him.
</p>

<p>
"Come quickly!"
</p>

<p>
We found him standing in the midst of
some bushes, where the snow had been
kicked away in a wide circle, affording
access to the tender green shoots beneath.
But there was no expression of joy on
his face, and as we came up The Crane
halted abruptly.
</p>

<p>
"Let us go away quickly," he muttered.
I was amazed at this, for it was plain to
me that here was the bed of a moose, and
I stared at the two men until Wapistan led
me over to the side of the little clearing.
</p>

<p>
"Let my brother look upon the tracks
of the Mighty One," was all he said.  There
before me were such tracks as I had never
seen&mdash;great imprints of sharp hoofs that
could only have been made by the giant
moose which had attacked us in the
beginning.  I have hunted many moose, since
then, but never have I found such a trail
as that.
</p>

<p>
"Listen, Uchichak," I said, trembling
with eagerness.  "If he is the Mighty One,
he must have been sent to us, for we are
far from the Hills.  Let us follow.  I will
hunt him, you need not."
</p>

<p>
"The Mighty One walks on the storm,"
murmured The Crane, glancing around
apprehensively.  None the less, my words
had impressed him.  "We will see whither
the tracks lead.  It may be that the Great
Spirit has sent him to his children.  He
may lead us to a herd of elk.  We will
follow a little way."
</p>

<p>
And therein was the beginning of our
strange pilgrimage.
</p>

<p>
Without delay we started out, Wapistan
leading and Uchichak bringing up the rear.
The great caution displayed by these
hunters told me more than any words could
have done that our quest was a dangerous
one.  With bows strung and ready, every
aisle of the forest was searched ahead of
us, and with every crack of sticks and trees
in the great frost I could see Wapistan
spring to alertness.  But all around us was
nothing save the deathly silence, through
which the frost-crackles and the
"sluff-sluff" of our snowshoes sounded loud.
</p>

<p>
Mile after mile we plowed along, from
patch to patch of forest, and still the deep
tracks of the giant beast led us onward.
The fresh-fallen snow had made heavy going
for him, since at each step he plunged
through to his knees.  The Crees might
consider that he walked on the wind, but
for my own part I thought him a feckless
creature to leave the shelter of the Hills
in such a storm.  And in that thought I
neglected the workings of Providence, as I
later admitted readily enough.
</p>

<p>
The trail presently led us to a fairly
large river, and out across the ice.  The
other bank was bordered with thick trees,
and as we neared them I turned to The
Crane and smiled.
</p>

<p>
"If the Mighty One walked on the storm,
Uchichak, it looks as though men had also
been able to walk there."
</p>

<p>
But the Indians had already caught sight
of the dark trail on the farther shore, and
with a guttural exclamation of surprise we
all dashed forward.  There in the shelter of
the trees the snow was not so deep, and
the tracks of the Mighty One led us
straight to a deep trail plowed in the snow,
where they were lost.
</p>

<p>
"Are they other hunters from the village?"
I asked in my ignorance.  The two
Crees kicked away their snowshoes and
crept about examining the trail, while I
leaned on my bow.  It was plain enough
that the Moose had gone forward in this
path, where the snow had been worn away
and packed deep for him, whereat I began
to think better of his sense.
</p>

<p>
Uchichak straightened up suddenly, and
at sight of his face I knew that something
was wrong&mdash;terribly wrong.  His usual
stolidity had given place to rage and grief,
and he turned to me with a flame in his
dark eyes.
</p>

<p>
"My brother, we must hasten to the
village at once.  Men have come and gone,
and they are not of our own people."
</p>

<p>
Still I realized nothing of what he
meant, although his face sobered me.
</p>

<p>
"Then do you go," I returned, "while
I continue on the trail of the Mighty
One&mdash;"  But Wapistan had sprung to my
side, eager and wrathful.
</p>

<p>
"Brave Eyes cannot read the trail," he
cried sharply.  "See, here have gone many
men&mdash;two or three tens of men.  Their
tracks lead away from the village, and with
them goes a dog-sled.  They travel toward
the Ghost Hills, and their snowshoes
are of Chippewa make.  Let us hasten,
my brothers!"
</p>

<p>
Then I groaned, for I remembered what
Radisson had said of Gib, called The Pike,
and his Chippewa followers.  If these men
had come to the village when the hunters
were away, what had happened?
</p>

<p>
Right speedily was all thought of the
Mighty One forgotten, as we took up the
trail in desperate haste toward the village.
Wapistan went on to say that it was very
fresh, that the band had not passed us
more than an hour previously, and in no
long time his words were borne out.  For,
as we turned a sharp bend in the
river-trail, we came upon two men striding
rapidly toward us.  They were not more
than a hundred yards away, and I did not
need Uchichak's hasty exclamation to tell
me that they were Chippewas.  For one was
our old friend Soan-ge-ta-ha, though the
other I knew not.
</p>

<p>
For a bare second we stared at each
other, then I saw the Chippewa chief throw
off the coverings of a musket.  I dashed
my two companions headlong, just as the
weapon roared out and gave vent to a
cloud of smoke.  The bullet sang overhead,
and at this unprovoked and cowardly
attack I picked up my strung bow and
drew it taut.
</p>

<p>
The two Chippewas had darted aside
just after the chief fired, and were speeding
for the shelter of the trees.  But my
arrow sped faster than they.  Even as
Uchichak and Wapistan darted forward,
I saw Brave Heart stumble, and the
musket flew far from him.  He was up and
running again, however, but the brief
pause had given my vengeful friends a
lead.  All four disappeared among the
trees, with wild cries that thrilled my heart.
</p>

<p>
I followed slowly after them, glad that
my savage aim had not gone true, for in
all my life I had never shed the
heart-blood of a man.  That these Chippewas
were enemies there was no doubt, and I
prudently stopped to recover the musket
dropped by the chief, for such things were
valuable.  A brief wonder came to me that
the weapon had not dismayed the two
Crees, but I hastened to follow them in
among the trees.  As I did so, I caught a
glimpse of something dark speeding toward
us from the direction of the village,
but I stopped not to see what it was.
</p>

<p>
From the trees and bushes came the
sound of men struggling, and when I had
broken through I saw the four in front.
Wapistan was calmly sitting in the snow,
wiping his long flint knife, and I turned
from him with a shudder.  Soan-ge-ta-ha
and Uchichak were at handgrips, but The
Crane plainly had the mastery over the
Chippewa chief, in whose shoulder still
stood my arrow.  Even as I plunged
forward through the snow, Brave Heart bent
backward, the knife dropped from his
nerveless fingers, and Uchichak stood up
to meet me.
</p>

<p>
"It was a good fight, brother!" he said
calmly.  "This Chippewa dog is only
faint from loss of blood.  The Marten has
sharp teeth, and is a warrior.  Good!"
</p>

<p>
I kneeled over Brave Heart, pulled the
arrow through his shoulder-muscles, and
roughly bound up the already freezing
wound.  As I did so, I told the others of
the dark object that I had seen approaching,
and Wapistan slipped away.  The
Crane aided me in getting Brave Heart
up with his back against a stump, and
barely had we done so when there was a
crash of bushes behind us, and in swept
Radisson, The Keeper, and Swift Arrow,
leading the same dog-sled which had been
prepared for our hunt of the Mighty One.
The Chippewa chief opened his eyes.
</p>

<p>
"Soan-ge-ta-ha," burst out Radisson
angrily in English, "your heart is bad!
You have led your warriors against the
Crees, stealing upon them in the night,
and you shall suffer for it bitterly!"
</p>

<p>
"What has happened?" I cried out, a
great fear rising in me.  "What does it
all mean?"
</p>

<p>
Brave Heart smiled cruelly, the two
Mohawks stood impassive.  Radisson turned
to me with a sudden sob shaking his great
frame, and his white-bearded face seemed
shot with lightnings as he made reply in
Cree, that the warriors might understand.
</p>

<p>
"What does it mean?  It means that
The Pike is on his last war-path, Davie!
Last night a band of thirty Chippewas
burst on the village.  The few men held
them back until most of the women could
escape with some few things, then&mdash;then
the village was destroyed."
</p>

<p>
A grunt broke from Uchichak, and his
hand went to his knife as he stood over
the wounded chief.  But I flung him away,
a question hot on my lips.
</p>

<p>
"Was it Ruth they were after?  Did
they harm her?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes and no, lad.  They bore her away
captive on a sled.  Fortunately, these dogs
and our sled had been hidden out of their
reach.  When the Mohawks and I returned
we took them and came after.  You shall
go forward with us, and we will follow
the party."
</p>

<p>
"What can we do against them?" I exclaimed
hopelessly.
</p>

<p>
"We can watch and wait," returned
Radisson grimly, with a significant look at
the two gaunt warriors beside him.  "Uchichak,
do you take this Chippewa back and
hold him captive.  Gather your hunters
speedily&mdash;even now they are coming in.  Send
a runner to the village of Talking Owl and
bid his young men join you.  Then follow
our trail, even though it may lead to the
Ghost Hills.  There, perhaps, The Pike
will imagine that you do not dare follow."
</p>

<p>
Uchichak said nothing.  He and Wapistan
jerked Brave Heart to his feet, replaced
his snowshoes for him, and the three
departed.  So suddenly and unexpectedly had
the dire news broken upon me, that I stood
as if dazed.  Radisson came and put a
kindly hand on my shoulder.
</p>

<p>
"Come, lad, all is not lost.  They will
not harm the little maid, and we must
hasten on their trail.  Not even The Pike
would dare harm her while their chief is a
captive.  Come, there is work for us ahead.
Now tell me your tale as we go forward."
</p>

<p>
Brokenly, I told him how we had come
upon the trail.  When I finished, Radisson's
face was lit with a stern glow, and he
raised a hand to the Mohawks.
</p>

<p>
"My brothers, the Great Spirit is
fighting for us!  The Mighty One has led
Brave Eyes to the trail.  He will lead us on
where the trail is lost!"
</p>

<p>
And that was the manner in which the
madness of Radisson began&mdash;a madness, I
think, which was sent by the Great Spirit
of whom he spoke.

<h3>
CHAPTER XIV.
<br /><br />
THE PURSUIT.
</h3>

<p>
When I speak of madness, I mean
nothing else.  From that moment
the old man was daft, as it seemed
to me.  We two led the way, the Mohawks
following after the sled, and Radisson set
such a place as I never traveled before or
since.
</p>

<p>
The mighty energy of the old man
dominated us all.  From his words I soon
saw that he had become filled with the
idea that the Moose had been sent to lead
us to Ruth again, until presently the
uncanny thought of it laid hold on me
likewise.  We took up the trail of the raiders,
which after a few miles crossed the river
and struck off straight for the northeast,
with the moose-tracks still following it.
</p>

<p>
Mile after mile we swung behind us.  I
wondered at Radisson's words&mdash;"where
the trail is lost"&mdash;for it seemed that a child
could follow such a plain, deep track as
this.  But he had not lived his life in the
wilderness for naught.  As we went
forward, he told of how the raiders must have
left before the great storm, and have
traveled through it, to spring on the village
with Indian cunning when they knew the
hunters would be gone.
</p>

<p>
Their object was plain enough, for Gib
thought to get a firm hold on Radisson by
the capture of Ruth, and perhaps to sell
that advantage to the English or French.
Both nations had wronged the terrible old
man deeply, and both would be like to go
wild when they heard that he was loose in
his own land again.  In the old days the
mere magic of his name, the terror inspired
by his countless daring escapades and
adventures, had more than once swept the
Bay clear of his foes.  I have often thought
that had the French not betrayed him so
shamefully, and had the English not
misused his great powers so basely, one
nation or the other would ere now have
ruled all the land from the Colonies to
the Bay.  There are wars and rumors of
wars in the land, however, and I have even
lately heard a wild rumor that our armies
have conquered all the Canadas; though
this is hardly possible, to my mind.  But
to return to my tale.
</p>

<p>
There was some dried meat on the
sledge, and this we ate as we traveled,
without stop.  The Chippewa party, fearful
of pursuit, were putting on all speed in a
desperate effort to gain the shelter of the
Hills before they were overtaken.  The
trail was fresh, and they could not go
faster than did we, for they were
handicapped by the sled which bore Ruth.
</p>

<p>
From Radisson I learned that Gib had
cunningly prevented his raiders from
injuring the people of the village.  He no
doubt knew that if Ruth alone were
carried off, the Crees would hesitate long
before venturing to follow him into the
sacred Hills.  But the savage instincts of
his followers had upset his crafty plans.
Soan-ge-ta-ha and another had stolen
back to pillage and burn and slay, thinking
to catch up easily with the party.  But for
us they would have done so, and now not
even the Ghost Hills would stay the
vengeful Crees from the pursuit.
</p>

<p>
At evening we halted for a brief half-hour,
to bait and rest the dogs.  Now the
weeks of hardening and hunting began to
bear fruit, for I had stood that terrific
pace nearly as well as the rest.  My ribs
were still somewhat sore at times, but in
the main I was heartier and stronger than
ever in my life before.
</p>

<p>
The rest was grateful to us all, and at
this time we loaded the fusils, together
with the musket taken from Brave Heart,
and covered them carefully on the sled.
We might have need of them at any time,
and to load was no short work.  For some
time I had seen no signs of Ruth's sled in
the trail we followed, and spoke of it to
the Keeper.
</p>

<p>
"It is there," he grunted.  "They are
following it, hiding it beneath their tracks."
</p>

<p>
"That looks as if they were getting
ready to lose the trail," put in Radisson.
He seemed to give no thought to this
possibility, taking it as a matter of course,
and the Mohawks only nodded.  It seemed
strange to me, but I held my peace.
</p>

<p>
When the Spirit of the Dead began to
dance in the sky we took up the march
again, goading the weary dogs to the trail.
Faint rumbles as of thunder seemed to
come from the heavens, but ever we
slapped on and on across the snows, while
grotesque shadows fell all around us as
the lights quivered above in lambent blue
and purple flames.  It was a wondrous
spectacle, far beyond any that I had seen
at home, where the lights were a common
occurrence, and I gave the Crees small
blame for naming them as they did.  To an
ignorant people those flaring fires of God
must indeed have seemed like spirits
leaping over the skies.
</p>

<p>
The deep trail led us straight through
forest and wild, open levels of snow.  Once
we came to a camping-place of the
Chippewas, where they too had made a brief
halt for food and rest.  Far beyond lay
the deep forest, and a wide curving line
of taller trees tokened that there was some
large river before us, or mayhap a lake.
</p>

<p>
And a lake it proved to be, set in the
midst of trees, with a small stream flowing
from it.  All was ice-coated, swept bare
of snow by the wind, and the trail led
straight to this sheet of ice.  Radisson
laughed grimly when we found this.
</p>

<p>
"Hold up, Davie.  We must have a
council here.  Do you stop with the dogs."
</p>

<p>
I obeyed, while the others set off in
different directions across the ice.  They
returned quickly enough, and with their
first words I knew that the trail was lost.
</p>

<p>
"They have scattered on the ice," spoke
up Swift Arrow.  "Three parties have
gone away from the farther shore."
</p>

<p>
Radisson nodded, his deep eyes searching
the trees around us.
</p>

<p>
"Then how do we know which to follow?"
I cried in dismay.  "Which party
took the sled with them?"
</p>

<p>
"That we know not, lad," he made
answer as if to a child.  "They have
followed after the sled, hiding its track.  It
might be with any of the three parties.
They will swing out in a wide circle and
then straight for the hills.  No matter
which we follow, we lose time.  An excellent
trick to fool children with, chief."
</p>

<p>
The Keeper merely grunted, while I
stared at them aghast.  Why did Radisson
take this so calmly?  But he gave me no
time to question.
</p>

<p>
"Did you find it?" he asked the Mohawks
simply.  Swift Arrow made answer.
</p>

<p>
"The Mighty One's trail goes alone.  It
goes toward the east, where lies the shadow
of the Ghost Hills."
</p>

<p>
Then in a flash I saw it all.  Radisson
proposed to abandon the Chippewa trails
and follow that of the beast!  The belief
that the animal had been sent to guide us
had overpowered all his woodcraft and
subtlety, and I flung out at him in wild
protest.
</p>

<p>
"It is madness!" I concluded angrily.
"Better to lose time and still be on the
track of the enemy, than to follow a
wandering beast!"
</p>

<p>
"Rail not against the wisdom of old
men," exclaimed Radisson sternly, his voice
ringing with confidence.  "The Mighty
One is guiding us, Davie.  Do you lead,
Keeper, while we come after.  We must
break trail now, and it will be no light
labor."
</p>

<p>
Raging against the old man's madness,
for so I deemed it, I set out with The
Keeper to break trail.  The Moose plunged
straight ahead for the Hills, and his long
legs had sunk almost to the shoulder at
every step.  I wondered how far ahead of
us he might be, and when The Keeper
knelt down quickly to smell the trail I
knew that we must be close upon him.
</p>

<p>
The fortitude and strength that dwelt in
the frame of the old chief was marvellous.
We broke the trail by turns, our shoes
stamping deep down through the soft crust
at each step, until it required every ounce of
endurance we possessed to keep on with
the labor.  Miles of it, hours of it, passed
by, and still we kept on at the same
terrific pace.  At times Radisson and Swift
Arrow relieved us, but ever we headed
straight for the Ghost Hills, whose
tree-clad and rocky summits now rose clear
against the lambent sky.  As we went, I
began to fall into Radisson's way of
thinking.  Perhaps, after all, that uncanny
Moose was leading us, guiding us straight
to our goal.  And whether it were the
silence of these waste and desolate barrens
around, or some inner feeling of the night,
I gained confidence that He who in truth
led us would not let harm come to the little
maid.
</p>

<p>
It seemed hours before we rested again,
and this time I flung myself down on a
skin from the sled, huddling among the
dogs for warmth, and slept.  Those three
old men must have been made of iron, for
when I awakened I saw The Keeper sitting
just as I had left him, alert and keen-eyed
as ever, while Swift Arrow and Radisson
were talking in low tones.
</p>

<p>
The poor brutes that hauled the sled
suffered even more than we did.  They
were worn to death, and before we started
out again, having fed them what we dared
from our slender stock of food, we cut up
our single robe which had covered the guns,
and bound their bleeding feet as best we
might.  They fell to the trail limping, but
there must have been something of the
Indian stolidity in them, for all that long
march I heard no cry, no whimper, burst
from their throats.
</p>

<p>
Now, for the first time, I thought of
Grim.  What had happened to him?  Where
was he?  At my questions Radisson smiled.
</p>

<p>
"He is faithful still, lad.  They said in
the village that he defended Ruth until Gib
would have killed him, when the lass
consented to go with them to save his life.
Grim stayed ever at her side, and is like
enough with her now."
</p>

<p>
This cheered me mightily, small hope
though it were.  Well I knew the wiliness
of that old sheep-dog, and that while Ruth
was endangered he would watch over her
even as my father would have done.  When
I took up the weary labor again it was with
better heart and more confident spirit than
since the start.
</p>

<p>
Now we knew that we could not be far
from the end of the terrible journey.  Or
at least my three comrades knew it, for I
refused to admit that there was aught save
madness in keeping to the moose-track.  The
snatch of sleep and food had cleared my
mind from the influence of the night, and
as we slapped on over the snows I railed
bitterly at myself for ever having
consented to it.
</p>

<p>
Slowly the hills ahead, purple in the
unearthly, flitting lights, drew closer and
towered ahead of us.  Slowly the wide
expanse of snow broke into little rises, then
we found ourselves among the first of the
Ghost Hills.  Before long I knew why they
had received that name.
</p>

<p>
They seemed to break straight out of the
ground&mdash;great masses of black rock like
that on the coast below Rathesby, at home.
As we drew among them, still following
that gigantic track left plain for us to read,
I saw that despite the heavy snow the black
masses of rock stood out bare and bleak,
closing around us and shutting out the
lights above.
</p>

<p>
The trail led downward now&mdash;down in a
winding line among the towering crags, and
we were passing over still deeper snow,
which had drifted from the hills.  As we
wound through the dark passages a swift,
chill wind smote us and cut to the marrow.
It was not my first taste of the bitter wind
of the Northland, which is infinitely harder
to endure than the most silent cold,
however great it may be.
</p>

<p>
Thus we were literally swallowed up in
that terrible abyss of rock and snow, and
the weird feeling of the place affected even
our dogs, who growled and shivered.  All
was dead silent, except for the rush and
howl of the wind, which seemed to shoot
down through those narrow pits of darkness,
until we could with difficulty stand
against it.  From somewhere ahead droned
out the long, eerie howl of a wolf, drifting
to us on the wind.  I saw Swift Arrow,
ahead of me, pause and throw up his head;
then into the teeth of the gale he cast an
answering howl&mdash;one as perfect as the
other, which drew a sharp yelp from the
dogs.  By this time I comprehended how on
board the "Lass" Radisson had so amazed
and shamed us all, and had even learned a
little of the mimicry myself.
</p>

<p>
It was fearful to drive ahead through
that gale, which sent the icy particles of
snow against us like tiny knives, and to
know that outside and above, the night was
silent and windless.  Indeed, there was
never any rest within the Ghost Hills, and
I could well realize why the Indians
dreaded and avoided them.
</p>

<p>
By now I was more than ever sure that
we were not only on the wrong track, but
that this Mighty One was sent by the foul
fiend to lead us astray and into danger of
the worst.  The passage of those hills was
terrible to the body and to the soul.  As
we drew deeper into the darkness, weird
echoes were set flying by our shoes and the
wind and the voices of us.  These were not
borne past, but seemed to eddy up overhead,
as though some flux of the wind caught
and whirled them back toward us.
</p>

<p>
The Keeper had been in the lead, Radisson
following.  Of a sudden, as we came
to a space somewhat lighter, I saw that the
chief had vanished!  I uttered a single cry
that rebounded about in mad echoes, but
Swift Arrow gripped me as I turned in
terror.
</p>

<p>
"Peace!  Ta-cha-noon-tia has but gone
ahead to see what lies before."
</p>

<p>
With the calm words my fear passed,
and I was ashamed.  After all, we were in
the hand of God, and if He willed that
evil should come to us, then it would come.
So I quelled my terror and pressed on
after the sledge.  A moment more, and the
passage was done with.
</p>

<p>
Turning the corner of a sharp cliff, we
found ourselves out in the night again,
standing on a ridge of bare black rock.  At
our side stood The Keeper.  Behind towered
those terrible cliffs, but ahead was a little
forested basin, alight with the fires of the
sky and stretching ahead to hills in the
distance.  Radisson turned to the Mohawk
with a question.
</p>

<p>
"My father, the tracks of the Mighty
One are lost and I do not see them.  But
below us are the lodges of warriors."
</p>

<p>
I looked again at the stretch of wooded
country.  Sure enough, I could see black
groups of something that might well be
huts or lodges, but there was no sign of
fire to cheer us.
</p>

<p>
"The Mighty One has led us well,"
shouted Radisson triumphantly.  "We have
arrived before them we seek!  Let us rest,
brothers, and make merry, for we are masters
of the stronghold of The Pike, and his
fate is in our hands!"
</p>

<p>
So for the rest of that night we lay
in the snow behind the ledge, while over
us the wind howled down into the cleft of
rocks, and around us the poor weary dogs
huddled in shivering groups, for we dared
light no fire, and had like to have frozen
in the great cold.  But the Moose had led
us aright, and the madness of Radisson was
justified&mdash;in part.
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><a id="chap15"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XV.
<br /><br />
OUTGENERALED.
</h3>

<p>
It was not far from dawn when we
arrived at the ridge, or ledge that ran
along the cliffs, with an easy descent
over the rolling snows to the basin beneath.
But as the dancing dead men paled in the
skies, the cold became too bitter for any of
us.  It was necessary that we light a fire
to keep from perishing, and the two Mohawks
disappeared to right and left.  It
was so cold that sleep was impossible, weary
as we were.
</p>

<p>
However, The Keeper returned and
motioned to us that we should accompany
him, and in a few moments we were
gathered in a deep cleft amid the rocks,
to one side of the terrible passage by
which we had come.  Here The Arrow met
us with some dry wood and birch-bark, and
before long we were gathered about a
smokeless fire, which at least served to
permit of our sleeping.
</p>

<p>
With one of us on watch at a time, the
day passed away.  After noon, I was
wakened and placed on guard at the crest
of the ridge, overlooking the basin.  A
little later, I saw a number of moving
objects off to the west, and speedily wakened
my companions, with a great relief and
joy in my heart.  The Mighty One had led
us aright!  Doubtless he himself had for
years made his home in these hills where
he was safe from man, and by following
his trail we had chanced on a short cut to
the heart of the Ghost Hills, while the
Chippewa band had been forced to take a
longer trail.
</p>

<p>
The moving objects resolved themselves
into the forms of men as they drew nearer,
clear and distinct in that atmosphere
which seemed to bring all things close to
us.  We watched silently, each knowing
that the others perceived all, and could
make out a sled with some dark object on
it.  There were barely a dozen men in the
party, so we knew the others had taken a
longer detour in order to throw off and delay
pursuit, and would doubtless arrive later.
</p>

<p>
"What will we do?" I murmured to
Radisson.  "We have little food, yet we
cannot make an attack on them."
</p>

<p>
He turned to the Mohawks, and the three
old men spoke for a few moments in the
Iroquois tongue.  Meanwhile, the Chippewa
party had come nigh the huts, and
presently I could see the light flare of
fire-smoke rising from the midst.  At the
distance, it was impossible to make out form
or feature, yet I had no doubt that the
burden lifted from the sled, and the dark
dot beside it, were Ruth and the faithful
Grim.
</p>

<p>
"It is hard to tell," said Radisson in
French, his fine face wrinkled in perplexity.
"We cannot make an open attack, for that
fiend Larue would kill the little maid
sooner than give her up.  It is plain that
they fear no enemy, since they are in the
open and that smoke could be seen afar.
</p>

<p>
"There are a score of them still out, and
it must be that they do not fear Uchichak's
men.  Possibly they have come along a trail
that Swift Arrow discovered and followed
last year.  He says it could be defended
by a few against an army.  I see naught to
do save to wait until night, and try to steal
down and get the little maid.  Could we
but get her up here, we might defend that
pass behind us against a thousand."
</p>

<p>
Swift Arrow grunted approval.  "The
Crees cannot break through the western
trail," he said.  "They grow faint at the
sight of blood.  The Chippewas are women,
also.  To-night we will steal down and
take away Yellow Lily."
</p>

<p>
I thought over his words, as I gazed on
the encampment below.  If he was right,
we might expect no aid, for that terrible
gulf through which we had come was unknown
to all men, and the trail followed
by Gib was doubtless secured against the
Crees.  But if only Uchichak&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Listen!" I cried out with the thought
blazing in me.  "We are but four, and
three of us could hold the mouth of that
gully&mdash;even this whole crest.  I cannot
drive dogs, nor do I know the ways of the
trail well enough; but Swift Arrow or The
Keeper could take the sled and drive back,
bringing Uchichak and his men by the trail
of the Mighty One.  Then to-night you
and the remaining Mohawks can attempt
the rescue of Ruth."
</p>

<p>
Radisson considered the matter in silence,
glanced at the impassive chiefs, and
received a grunt which tokened approval.
With no more parley, Great Swift Arrow
drew down his fur hood and picked up the
thong which served as a dog-whip.
</p>

<p>
"I will go," he declared calmly as ever.
"I will find you waiting in the pass?"
</p>

<p>
"In the pass," echoed Radisson.
</p>

<p>
Without more ado, the dogs, snarling and
protesting, were forced into the harness,
The Arrow cracked his whip, and he was
gone along the ridge toward the mouth
of the pass, as if the long trip before him
was no more than a pleasure excursion.
He had left the guns, all save one, together
with most of the dried meat.
</p>

<p>
Radisson and I went forth to a group
of pines which grew in the shelter of the
ridge, and when we returned with some
store of dry wood we found The Keeper
curled up asleep.  The Indians seemed to
have the power of sleep whenever they
wished, and Radisson chuckled.
</p>

<p>
"Do you keep guard, lad, while I sleep
also.  Wake me at midday."
</p>

<p>
I nodded, for I felt no great need of
sleep, and the old man sat down beside his
friend, feet to the fire.  I left the cranny
in the rocks and went forth a few paces
into the sunlight's warmth, where I could
overlook the encampment of The Pike.
Here, crouched down in hiding, I set
myself to wait as patiently as might be until
the appointed time should pass.
</p>

<p>
The camp below was too far away for
any sound to reach us, but from the absence
of all sign of life I gathered that the
Chippewas were resting after their terrific
march.  I felt none of the Mohawk's
contempt for them; indeed, they seemed to
me to be men to be reckoned with to the
utmost, and as for Gib o' Clarclach, I had
already experienced enough of his craft to
know that he was no mean foe.
</p>

<p>
Toward midday I saw a number of dark
forms appear to the westward, and as they
drew near there came a faint barking of
dogs down the wind.  There were a scant
half-dozen men in the arriving party, and
the others turned out to meet them, after
which all disappeared within the huts.
Plainly, Gib considered that half a score
men were enough to guard the western
trail, which showed that it must be
well-nigh impassable to Uchichak.
</p>

<p>
Then weariness came upon me, and I
awoke Radisson, who yielded me his place
beside the fire.  Covering my head, I was
soon fast asleep despite the cold, and when
I woke again it was to find the day all but
spent and The Keeper gone.
</p>

<p>
"Eat as little as may be, Davie," said
Radisson as I warmed some of the frozen
meat before the fire.  "We have none too
much to last us."
</p>

<p>
So I scarce touched the little supply of
food.  There was no more to be had unless
we retraced our steps into the Barren
Places, or descended into the forested basin
to seek the game that must be plentiful
there.  Indeed, as I later learned, the place
was thick with game, for the animals knew
well that here they were safe from hunters.
</p>

<p>
The Keeper, it seemed, was scouting.  I
marvelled how the old chief could venture
forth, but Radisson explained that the
Chippewas seemed to keep but a slight watch,
and for all my gazing I could see no signs
of the Mohawk.
</p>

<p>
"How long, think you, ere Swift Arrow
comes upon the Crees?"
</p>

<p>
Radisson shrugged his shoulders.  "No
telling, lad.  He would not have gone
through to the outside before noon at the
earliest, and the dogs were sore spent.  If
he should chance upon them to the westward,
he might be here by morning; but
it may well be two or three days until their
arrival.  We must be far from the trail of
The Pike."
</p>

<p>
This was scant consolation, and so we
waited in silence.  Still came no sign of
The Keeper, and soon the Spirits of the
Dead were dancing to the north, faintly.  It
must have been that age had dimmed the
cunning of Radisson, for as I foolishly
placed more wood on the fire, he made no
comment.  Suddenly from out of the darkness
came a swift stream of words, angry
and vehement, in the voice of The Keeper.
</p>

<p>
The result astonished me, for with one
swift leap Radisson had sprung past me
and was kicking the fire into embers over
the snow.  I was on my feet instantly,
staring amazed at the tall figure of the
chief.
</p>

<p>
"What is the matter?  Surely our fire
could not be seen from below?"
</p>

<p>
The Keeper grunted sarcastically.  "Has
my father lost his cunning?  Has White
Eagle been dreaming the dreams of women?
From below the fire is hid, but the
reflection of the fire was high on the cliffs."
</p>

<p>
Radisson, Indian-like, grunted disgustedly,
and finished the last ember with his
heel.  But he said nothing, merely looking
to the Mohawk inquiringly.
</p>

<p>
"There are two tens of men," reported
the Keeper briefly.  "The Pike is their
chief.  Their lodges are old.  The Yellow
Lily is there, also a woman of the
Chippewas.  One of their young men I met,
gathering wood."
</p>

<p>
He touched his robes, as if beneath them
lay something concealed.  Radisson's words
told me what that something was.  The old
man spoke quite as a matter of course.
</p>

<p>
"Then The Keeper will have another
scalp to hang in the smoke of his lodge.
Think you they saw the reflection of our
fire?"
</p>

<p>
The Mohawk shrugged his shoulders and
made no reply.  The two might have been
discussing the weather or the stars for all
the emotion they displayed, instead of the
vital danger which threatened us all.  And
now I began to feel that the disdain
expressed by the two Mohawks was not
groundless.  They were of another race than
the chattering Crees and Chippewas.  They
seemed to hold themselves aloof, as if
theirs was the heritage of more than these
other men might comprehend.  And truly
I think it was, for there was in the whole
bearing of The Keeper a great grimness,
like unto the grimness of Fate, and at times
since I have wondered if he could have seen
some hint of what his end was to be.
</p>

<p>
We were now in darkness, save for the
rising gleam of the fires in the sky.  It
seemed that Radisson and the Mohawk
intended to wait until later in the night
before they stole down to rescue Ruth.  The
cold was now intense, but despite my
shiverings I saw that both Radisson and the
Indian were listening to something that I
could not hear.  From the trees below rose
a long wolf-howl, answered faintly by the
voices of the Chippewa dogs.
</p>

<p>
"That was a poor cry, Keeper," and
Radisson rose to his feet noiselessly.  Then
the snow crunched and crackled, and I
saw the two slipping into the long shoes.
One by one the guns were examined and
primed afresh, and Radisson turned to me.
</p>

<p>
"We will steal down and wait, lad.  Do
you come to the crest of the ridge, there
to cover our retreat if need be."
</p>

<p>
Picking up the extra guns, I donned my
snowshoes and we stepped forth from the
shelter of the niche in the cliffs.  Out to
the north the sky was just beginning to
blaze in the spirit-dance, and the faint
glimmer of light among the trees betokened
a campfire, while behind us rose the gaunt,
bleak cliffs.  To right and left in a long
curve swept the bare-blown, bowlder-strewn
ridge, and for a moment we stood watching.
</p>

<p>
On a sudden The Keeper whirled about,
and as he did so I heard a sharp, clear
note behind.  Something struck me and
bounded away from my furs, and even as
the whistle of another arrow rang past,
Radisson had flung me from my feet.  A
gunshot split the night, and another, and
one lone, weird yell rose up.
</p>

<p>
"Cover, Davie, cover!" cried Radisson,
slipping behind a bowlder.  The Mohawk
had clean vanished, but his voice quavered
out in a single soul-rending war-cry such
as I had never heard before.  Then, gun
in hand, I was crouching beside Radisson.
</p>

<p>
"That was poor aiming," he muttered.
"They should have downed us at the first
fire, or waited until&mdash;ah!"
</p>

<p>
Once more a musket spoke from the darkness,
and the bullet crashed on the bowlder.
Radisson fired instantly, then a choking cry
came back to us.  Now I realized that Gib
had indeed seen our fire and with his
cunning had surrounded us.  Had he waited
until daylight, we had never left that
ridge alive, but doubtless the impatience of
his warriors had overruled his craftiness.
</p>

<p>
"Wait here, lad," whispered Radisson
as he reloaded, "while I seek The Keeper.
We must not let daylight find us here."
</p>

<p>
If it did, it would find us frozen, I
thought, while the arrows pattered around.
No sign of any foe had I seen, but the
blaze of the heavens began to light the dark
face of the cliff as Radisson crawled away.
Above, nestling against the face of the
cliff, was a patch of drifted snow, and as
my eyes grew accustomed to the light it
seemed to me that across this a shadow
moved.
</p>

<p>
I set my fusil in rest, and of a sudden
my trembling hands grew firm again, as
I drew a careful sight on that patch of
snow.  A shadow struck against it and
wavered there, and in that instant I fired.
While the long echoes of the shot died
away on the farther cliffs, something
crashed and was silent.
</p>

<p>
Before I could withdraw the gun, an
arrow pierced my fur sleeve and quivered
loosely in my arm.  I jerked it away, for
the hurt was but slight, and reloaded.
Then came a shot from somewhere to my
left, and again that long, heart-splitting
yell of the Mohawk shrilled up.  It was
answered by two sudden shots, and catching
up one of the spare guns beside me I
fired at the flashes.
</p>

<p class="capcenter">
<a id="img-068"></a>
<img class="imgcenter" src="images/img-068.jpg" alt="&quot;I backed against the bowlder and shook them off, sending one sprawling with every blow.&quot;" />
<br />
&quot;<i>I backed against the bowlder and shook them off, <br />
sending one sprawling with every blow.</i>&quot;
</p>

<p>
This drew on me another shower of
arrows, and a bullet that spat into the
bowlder at my side and rebounded past
my car.  This had come from behind, and
with a sudden fear I turned.  As I did so
a yell that seemed to come from the throats
of devils rang through the night, and I saw
a number of dark forms leaping upon me.
With swift terror in my heart, I sprang
up, forgetting the fusils at my feet, and
met them with clenched fists.  I saw a pale
glint of steel and struck out with all my
strength, shouting aloud for Radisson.  Then
my fear dropped away from me as the first
man went down beneath my fist, and I
stepped forward, raging.  The leaping,
yelling demons seemed all about me, but I
backed against the bowlder and shook them
off, sending one sprawling with every blow.
I caught the exultant voice of Gib, and
leaped at a dark form ahead; catching him
about the waist, I felt strength surge into
me and heaved him high&mdash;then something
came down on my head and I fell asleep
with the sting of snow on my face.

<h3>
CHAPTER XVI.
<br /><br />
A VOICE IN THE NIGHT.
</h3>

<p>
I knew no more of what passed until I
found myself lying on a pile of skins,
my head throbbing painfully.  Opening
my eyes, I saw that I was lying beside a
fire, while around me were Chippewas, and
standing over me was my enemy.
</p>

<p>
"Awake, eh?" said Gib softly, in the old
Gaelic, which he spoke with the Highland
burr.  There was an evil smile on his
crafty face as I struggled to sit up.  For
a wonder, I was not bound, which I
suppose he did not deem necessary.
</p>

<p>
"You are a troublous fighter, MacDonald,"
he sneered.  "But with the great
Radisson dead, you will have hard work
to squeeze out of this pocket of mine."
</p>

<p>
"Radisson&mdash;dead?" I echoed dizzily.
The shock of it cleared my head and I
looked up at him.  "You lie, Gib
o' Clarclach!  No dog such as you could slay
Pierre Radisson!  His fate lies in higher
hands than yours!"
</p>

<p>
"So?" he snarled, sudden rage whelming
in him.  Swiftly, he reached out and
kicked me with a vicious foot.  I gathered
myself together, but brown hands gripped
me and held me there helpless, while he
raved wildly in his madness.  And by that
I knew that he had lied, and that Radisson
was not dead.  So I laughed at him as
they bound me hand and foot.
</p>

<p>
More than one of his men seemed
wounded beneath their furs, and beside the
fire lay two silent warriors.  We were in
the center of the group of lodges, and as
there were but half a score of men around
me, I gathered that the rest were scattered
through the trees on watch.  There was no
sign of Ruth, and with that I set myself
to taunt mine enemy, speaking in the Cree
which all his men doubtless could understand.
</p>

<p>
"You are a fine leader of men, my
brother!  Well were you called The
Pike&mdash;crafty, cowardly warrior who shuns the
shallow water!  See, in our village lies
your chief Soan-ge-ta-ha, while our women
laugh at him, and in the snow lies one of
his young men, dead.  The Cree knives are
sharpened, my brothers, and with them are
the knives of Radisson, the White Eagle,
and of his friends, the Brothers of the
Thunder."  For this was the name by
which the two Mohawks went in all that
north country.
</p>

<p>
My words, as they were designed, sent
a swirl of rage through the Chippewas,
who with a growl turned on Gib.  But he,
the crafty one, appeased them swiftly.
</p>

<p>
"Brave Heart is not hurt, my brothers,"
he cried.  "My medicine tells me that he
is even now on his way to join us.  As for
you, Brave Eyes, you lie.  The White Eagle
has no men with him&mdash;only the tall
Mohawk chief."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, mayhap," I answered, "but these
twain are more than a match for your
Chippewa women.  You stole upon our
village, and what gained you?  Only one poor
captive.  It was a great raid, worthy of
The Pike, and you have paid for it dearly
with your chief and your young men.  And
the White Eagle is sharpening his claws,
my brothers&mdash;out there in the night somewhere."
</p>

<p>
My words reached them, and more than
my words.  For barely had I finished, when
the darkness was split asunder by a
musket-shot.  The man beside Gib whirled about
and fell into the fire.
</p>

<p>
"Scatter!" foamed Gib, raging.  "Scatter
and slay the White Eagle, fools!  Out
with the fire!"
</p>

<p>
The embers were dashed over the snows
instantly, and under his rapid orders the
band vanished.  Two of them remained to
lift me, and they carried me to the door
of one of the lodges, a little apart from
the rest.  Gib flung away the flap, and by
the light of the lodge-fire inside I saw the
pale, frightened face of Ruth.
</p>

<p>
"What means this intrusion?" she
demanded in French, not seeing me.  "I
thought we were to remain unmolested!"
</p>

<p>
The scoundrel tendered her a low,
mocking bow, and stepped aside to show my
figure, as the two braves flung me at her
feet.  She gave but a little frighted cry, and
stood facing him.
</p>

<p>
"A meeting of old friends, Mistress de
Courbelles."  It was the first time I had
heard Ruth's name from other than the lips
of Radisson.  "How could I separate such
dearly loved ones?  See, I bring you a
visitor of great value, and ere long you
will have others.  So I bid you good-even."
</p>

<p>
With this he bowed again and was gone.
Outside came his voice giving sharp orders,
and all was still.  But Ruth sprang
forward and was on her knees beside me.
</p>

<p>
"My poor Davie!" she cried, lifting my
head in her arms.  "Some water, Laughing
Snow!"
</p>

<p>
From out the shadows moved the figure
of a Cree woman&mdash;a sister of Uchichak's,
whom the Chippewas had carried away to
care for Ruth.  She brought water, and the
two of them bathed my wounded head,
where I had been struck down from behind.
As they did so, I told them all that
had passed.
</p>

<p>
"It was the night after you and The
Crane left for the hunt," Ruth told me,
"that the Chippewas came.  For a little
while the old men held them off, which
gave most of the women time to flee.  I
had just left my lodge to find the cause
of the shouting when Gib's party broke
through.  They seized me, set fire to the
lodges, and were gone again.  Oh, they
treated me kindly enough, Davie, but&mdash;but
I cannot bear that smiling, evil face of
Gib!"
</p>

<p>
"Be not afraid, sister," spoke out the
Cree woman, stolidly.  "The Crane is a
great warrior, and his men must be very
near.  These Chippewa women will flee
before him like leaves before the wind of
autumn."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I think that Gib's plans were all
upset by Brave Heart," I tried to reassure
the little maid bravely enough.  "But for
him, and for the Mighty One, we had never
been here, Ruth.  As it is, the Swift Arrow
will bring Uchichak and his men."
</p>

<p>
"We have been foolish," declared Laughing
Snow bitterly.  She went on to tell us
how, years ago, it had been rumored that
men lived in the Ghost Hills.  By piecing
together the fragments of Radisson's tales
and this of hers, Ruth and I gathered that
Gib o' Clarclach had maintained a sort of
robber band in these dreaded hills in the
old days, when French and English were
at war on the Bay.  Gib had afterwards,
when Radisson dwelt in England, made
the journey from the Canadas with d'Iberville
and his raiders, and had guided them
to the English posts when the French
swept them clean.  The villain had served
both sides, lending himself wherever the
more gain promised, and the Cree woman
prophesied that once these things were
known in the land, her people would make
a war on the Chippewas that would go
down in fable long afterwards.  So indeed
they did, but these things came in after
years and have no part in this my tale.
</p>

<p>
There was little sleep for us that night.
We had all rested during the day, I high
on the ridge, and Ruth in the lodge, for
the trip had been a hard one.  The two
women told how they had come through
deep gorges, like those by which we had
followed the Mighty One, and how they
had given up all hope of rescue.
</p>

<p>
Now came something which has ever
left a great wonder in my mind&mdash;one of
those turns of chance which come in the
most desperate straits.  For, when my bonds
had been removed, Ruth took from its skin
wrappings a little book and showed it to me.
</p>

<p>
"I found this in the lodge," she said
slowly.  "Look upon the title-page, Davie,
and see if I have been dreaming or not.
It seems very hard to believe."
</p>

<p>
The book was a little leather-bound
Bible.  As the Cree woman put a flare of
birch on the fire, I held it to the light and
opened it.  There in faded ink were words
written, and I copy them from the Book
which lies before me as I write.  They
were in the Dutch tongue, and as follows:
</p>

<p class="quote">
"To Hendrik, to bear with him
always in the desert places, that he
may make straight in the wilderness
a highway for our God.  From his
beloved wife.  A.D. 1605."
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
And under this, in a firm writing that
bespoke strength, were the English words,
"Henry Hudson, his book."  I stared
again, scarce crediting the thing, then
looked up to meet the grave, fearful eyes
of Ruth.  We had both heard the story
many a time&mdash;how the bold sailor had been
set adrift in an open boat, with his son
and a few faithful ones, and how they
had vanished.  Just a century since, 1610,
had this thing taken place, and no word
had ever come to England of Henry
Hudson, through all the years between.
</p>

<p>
"Then," I almost whispered, "think you
that this was really his?  How came it
here?"
</p>

<p>
"It speaks for itself," and Ruth dropped
beside me and fingered the Book reverently.
"Think of it, Davie!  In the midst of the
wilderness, in the midst of foes, to come
into an empty lodge and find this thing!
Does it not seem like a message of faith
and hope?"
</p>

<p>
"As to that," I responded, "like enough.
But I was thinking on the marvel of it,
Ruth.  It must even be that Hudson, who
was thought to have perished in the waters
of the Great Bay, escaped to land.  Else
how could this Bible have come here?  How
could Gib have obtained it?  Perhaps from
the Indians."
</p>

<p>
With this I turned to Laughing Snow
and questioned her closely.  But she
disclaimed all knowledge of the Book, and
said that never before the coming of
Radisson had white faces been seen in the
northern lands.
</p>

<p>
For a time we discussed the wonder,
failing to gain any information from the
Cree woman, but my bandaged head hurt
painfully, and after the first surprise I
leaned back, faint and weak.  Then Ruth
took the little volume, warped and stained
with time and sea-water, and read to us
aloud.  As she read, she translated into
Cree for the benefit of the other.
</p>

<p>
I was quite content to lie silently and
gaze at her.  Very beautiful she seemed
there in the faint fire-glow, which tinged
her golden hair with ruddy hues and
likened her grave, sweet face with the rise
and fall of the flames.  Her heavy beaver-skins
were laid aside, and her inner dress
of soft doeskin was decorated with the
beautifully marked neck-skins of loons,
which Radisson had brought her.  Porcupine
quills and shell beads fringed her
moccasins, while at her throat gleamed that
same little gold brooch which had led us
so far and brought upon us so much
trouble.
</p>

<p>
Through all our journeys I had kept by
me that stained and torn fragment of my
father's Bible, and when she had done I
wrapped it up again in the skin with the
volume that had been Henry Hudson's, and
gave them into the keeping of Ruth.  Barely
had we settled back when the skin flap
was pushed aside, and once more Gib o'
Clarclach entered.
</p>

<p>
"I would have some speech with you,
David," he announced, no longer smiling,
but purposeful and shrewd.  Closing the door
to keep out the cold, he seated himself on
some skins and stared at me across the
fire.  I made him no answer.
</p>

<p>
"My young friend, these Chippewas of
mine, I keenly regret, are not used to the
customs of civilized war.  Yet they are far
ahead of your Mohawk friends, whom I
have seen tie their captives to a tree and
build a fire round about.  These Chippewas
have another method, which is quite as
effective; for instead of a fire, they shoot
arrows until the victim is like a porcupine
with his quills erect.  Then they shoot for
the heart."
</p>

<p>
"Well, have on your murderers," I replied,
knowing well that he dared not for
the sake of Soan-ge-ta-ha.  "Methinks their
chief will suffer if I do."
</p>

<p>
"That is exactly the trouble, my bold
young friend," he answered me.  "Personally,
it matters little to me what becomes
of the chief, for he disobeyed my orders.
But his warriors take another view of the
situation.  They would have me be fool
enough to turn you loose so that their chief
may be restored to them."
</p>

<p>
"Then they may save their worry," I
shot back bluntly enough.  "If you want
Brave Heart, give the maid here back."
</p>

<p>
"Ah, that is impossible," his suave
answer irritated me the more.  "For her,
we are to receive many fine gifts at the
Post&mdash;beads and powder and blankets
and&mdash;other things.  No, I deeply regret that I
am unable to meet your just demand.  But
on the other hand, as I was about to propose,
unless you consent to parley with Radisson
for the return of the chief, my warriors
will insist on using you as a target."
</p>

<p>
Ruth stared at him with frighted eyes,
but I knew well enough that the man spoke
in deadly earnest.  Could I have had my
way of it, I would have bade him do his
worst; but a little hand fluttered down to
my wrist, and I could not withstand the
unspoken appeal of Ruth.
</p>

<p>
"Have it your own way, then," I
growled.  "I suppose you would have me
seek my friends at once?"
</p>

<p>
"Not till the day, sweet sir," smiled the
scoundrel.  "My men are all about, and
there is no danger of your two or three
eager friends inflicting any more damage.
I do not quite understand how you got
in here, unless you were hunting&mdash;no, that
could not be either."
</p>

<p>
He fell to musing, staring at me, whereat
I laughed harshly.
</p>

<p>
"It was no hand of man led us here,
Gib o' Clarclach, make sure of that."
</p>

<p>
"Then we will even ascribe it to the
foul fiend," and he got to his feet.
"Good-even for the last time, mistress!"
</p>

<p>
When he had gone we sat silent, all
three.  Presently the Cree woman fell
asleep in her corner and the fire slowly
died down to a dim red glow, while Ruth
and I sat hand in hand.  On the morrow,
it seemed like, I would go forth and
bargain for my worthless skin, leaving
her in the hands of our enemies.  Bitterly
I cursed myself for a faint-heart, though I
knew full well that ere long Uchichak and
his warriors would turn the tide of affairs.
</p>

<p>
The long hours passed, and still I sat
sleepless, Ruth having fallen half into
slumber, her head resting against my
shoulder.  I was staring at the skin wall of
the lodge, where it was lashed into the
brush beyond, and was dreaming again
of that terrible voyage and of its ending,
when I started suddenly.  The glow of
the embers had seemed to strike a spark
from the wall&mdash;a tiny point of light that
moved across the skin!
</p>

<p>
In a moment I knew it was a knife-blade
slitting the tough hide, whereat I
brought Ruth wide awake.  The skin seemed
to fall apart in silence, and through it
glared a horrible painted mask and staring
eyes.  Ruth clutched my arm, in fright, but
a whisper came from the darkness.
</p>

<p>
"Brave Eyes!  Come swiftly!"  And I
knew it for the voice of The Keeper.
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><a id="chap17"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XVII.
<br /><br />
A MARTYR OF THE SNOWS.
</h3>

<p>
It was Ruth who woke me from my
stupid amazement, pushing me to my
feet as The Keeper whispered again.
How that crafty Mohawk had pierced the
ring of Chippewas, I never knew, but his
forest skill must have been far beyond
theirs.  I remembered the little buckskin
bag of paint which always hung at his
girdle, and knew that he must have prepared
himself according to his own custom.
</p>

<p>
But my wits came back to me quickly
enough, and I pushed Ruth forward to the
opening, first stamping out the embers lest
they betray us.  As quietly as might be I
helped her through the narrow slit, the
Mohawk receiving us on the other side, and
Grim following.  Then we were standing in
the shelter of a small fir, and for a wonder
the skies were dark save for the eternal
stars.  I looked about for Radisson, but he
was not to be seen.
</p>

<p>
"Come!" breathed The Keeper, leading
the way through the snow.  None of us wore
snowshoes, but the crust was firm enough
to support us, with the intense cold of
those nights.  There was no sound around
us save the crackle of the frost as the
trees creaked in the wind, nor was any
fire visible.
</p>

<p>
Yet I knew that all about us were men
watching and listening.  It seemed hardly
possible that we should win through to
the ridge where I supposed that Radisson
waited, but gradually we left the camp
behind.  Once we were beyond the circle
of trees would come the danger, although
the absence of the lights seemed to protect
us somewhat.  We went cautiously and
slowly, and it must have been fifteen
minutes before the trees thinned out around
us.
</p>

<p>
Then, without warning, a sudden
streamer of flame quivered and hung
across the skies, and the lights were
dancing, lighting up all things in grotesque
shadow-gleams.  I knew we were lost, even
before a dark form bounded into the snow
before us and a shrill yell went up that
echoed across the night.
</p>

<p>
"Go!" exclaimed The Keeper in French,
pushing Ruth ahead.  "Run to the crest
yonder, where White Eagle waits!"  I sent
Grim with a quick word also.
</p>

<p>
Ruth, with a little sobbing cry, obeyed,
and the Mohawk flung himself in one great
leap on the figure which was coming toward
us.  Steel flashed in the half-light and
the two went down together.  But other
forms were yelling at our heels, and if
Ruth was to be saved this was no time to
run.  We must hold them back for a
moment or two.
</p>

<p>
The Keeper rose swiftly and put into my
hand the heavy stone ax he had taken
from the Chippewa.  Then, gripping knife
in one hand and tomahawk in the other,
he waited at my side as the warriors came
at us.  Glancing around, I saw Ruth's dark
figure vanishing over the snows toward
the ridge; as I later learned, she thought
we were close behind her, else had she
never deserted us.
</p>

<p>
"Now, brother!" grunted The Keeper.
"Back to back!"
</p>

<p>
With a swirl of snow the dark figures
were on us.  But the yells of rage turned
to warning cries as that huge ax of mine
swung up and down, and the lithe Mohawk
used his two hands with the swiftness of a
panther.  They drew back, then came at
us again; this time I knew the form of The
Pike for their leader, and sprang out to
meet him with my ax whirled aloft.
</p>

<p>
He avoided my stroke, leaping aside and
stooping in the snow.  Ere I could fathom
his intent the others were upon me,
pressing me back to the side of the Mohawk.
They shrank before that crashing ax and
swift tomahawk, and with each blow I
caught an approving grunt from the old
warrior beside me.  We were ringed about
with dark forms in the snow, silent and
motionless, when I caught sight of Gib
again.
</p>

<p>
Too late, I saw his aim.  He had broken
off a huge section of the snow-crust, and
as I turned to meet him he flung the mass
in my face, blinding me and sending me
staggering.  In vain did I strike out
blindly, for hands gripped my throat and bore
me back fighting furiously into the snow.
I heard a single long yell from The Keeper,
and as I went down saw a gleam of light
dart from his hand.  The tomahawk whirled
into one of the men who gripped me, but
it was of no avail.  I was choked into
helplessness and when something hit my
wounded head, I knew no more.
</p>

<p>
Once again I wakened to find myself
lying beside a fire, but now it was the
broad daylight.  My head scarcely pained,
though my throat was sore where I had
been gripped, and I was fast bound.  With
a turn of the head it was easy to see all
that lay around.
</p>

<p>
At my side was The Keeper, in similar
plight to mine, though his face seemed old
and gray and sunken and his furs were red
with frozen blood.  He lay quiet, his eyes
closed, but the sudden fear that he was dead
departed when I saw the rise and fall of
his breast.  His painted face was hideous,
yet could not mask the age and weakness
and strength of the man; weak he was in
body, wounded and spent, but his spirit was
as strong as that of Pierre Radisson himself.
</p>

<p>
Sullen and cursing, the Chippewas were
grouped about the fire.  More than one of
them lay helpless, or with rude-bandaged
wounds, and all were eying the Mohawk
and me with malignant ferocity.  But Ruth
was uppermost in my mind.  Had she
been saved?  Or had The Keeper's sacrifice
been vain?
</p>

<p>
Guessing from the sun, it was early
morning.  I looked across and up to the
ridge of cliffs, and imagined that I could
see a thin trail of smoke ascending.
Whether it were my imagination or no, I
could not tell for sure; still, the thought
cheered me.  At the least, Radisson must
be safe, and of Ruth I would soon learn.
</p>

<p>
But the time dragged on, and by midday
intolerable thirst consumed me.  The
Mohawk had by now come out of his swoon,
and lay staring straight up into the sky,
nor did I venture to bespeak him.  Presently
there was a stir about the fire, and from
one of the lodges came Gib.  Then he
entered that wherein Ruth and I had lain,
and came back to us with that little skin
package which we had forgot in the haste
of our flight.  He unrolled it and laughed
shortly.  At a curt order from him The
Keeper and I were brought up sitting,
against a small hemlock.  But when Gib
had come to that torn cover of my father's
Bible, his face changed horribly, and he
flung the whole from him as if it burnt
his hands&mdash;as very possibly it did.
</p>

<p>
"So, dog of an Iroquois," he snarled
at The Keeper, his features convulsed with
rage, "it is you whom I have to thank for
the loss of men and captive, eh?  <i>Mort de
ma vie</i>!  But you shall suffer for this, and
speedily!"
</p>

<p>
So he raged, cursing in French, Gaelic
and a dozen more tongues, while the
Chippewas silently and grimly made ready
their arrows and bows.
</p>

<p>
"You, MacDonald," went on Gib at
length, "shall see what your fate will be
if Brave Heart be not returned to us safe.
As for the girl, I shall have her in the
end&mdash;and would have her back here ere
this, but there is no place she can flee
to, and my men are athirst for revenge."
</p>

<p>
From which I judged shrewdly enough
that the Chippewas had refused to face the
fire of Radisson from the ridge, after my
fall, and that Ruth had escaped to him.
This was mightily cheering, and now I
cared not what took place, since the little
maid was safe.
</p>

<p>
At word from Gib, two or three of the
Chippewas sprang forward and pulled The
Keeper to his feet, loosing his bonds and
mine and casting off his furs until he
stood naked to the waist.  The old
warrior was scarred with new wounds and old,
and I judged that he had not gone down
in last night's struggle without giving more
than one deathblow.  His sinewy bronze
figure drew a look of admiration from the
surrounding warriors, and when the power
of movement was restored to him he
quietly leaned over and picked up the little
Bible which had been Henry Hudson's.
</p>

<p>
"So," sneered Gib at this, noting also
the emblem of the Cross that hung around
the neck of the old Mohawk, "you are of
the faith of the blackrobes, Iroquois?  Say,
will you not accept life and a chieftainship
among the Chippewas?"
</p>

<p>
Before The Keeper could reply to the
Cree words, one of the other warriors
stepped forth and spoke in the same
tongue.
</p>

<p>
"Old man, you are a brave warrior.
Last night you fought well.  Beside the fire
lies my older brother.  His squaw will
mourn for him.  You shall take his place
at our councils, and be a chief among us."
</p>

<p>
Quiet scorn flashed into the proud, haggard
face of the old man, but he said no
word, and once again Gib taunted him with
his creed.
</p>

<p>
"Give up that thing about your neck,
Iroquois, fling that book into the snow,
and you shall be a great man among us and
saved from the torture.  How say you?
What avails your faith now?  Is it stronger
than Chippewa arrows?  Can it break the
Chippewa bows?"
</p>

<p>
The Keeper turned and faced him.  Into
the stern old features had crept a light
that seemed unearthly, and he looked at
Gib as though he had seen some other
behind him, so that more than one of the
warriors glanced about uneasily.  Still
holding the Book, the old Mohawk answered
slowly, unheeding the bitter cold in
his fresh wounds.
</p>

<br />
&quot;<i>Still holding the book, the old Mohawk answered slowly, <br />
unheeding the bitter cold in his fresh wounds.</i>&quot;
</p>

<p>
"The Pike is a great warrior.  He was
among the Iroquois many years ago.  He
has seen how warriors of the Five Nations
die, and the sight has frightened him.  He
has fled to the Chippewas, and has put
on the robes of a squaw.  He asks me,
the Keeper of the Eastern Door of the
Long-house, Ta-cha-noon-tia, if my faith
is stronger than Chippewa arrows!  Listen,
my brothers.
</p>

<p>
"I am very old.  I am on my last war-trail,
and I can see that it is almost ended,
and I am glad.  But in the snow beside
The Pike there is a trail.  What is that
which stands behind you, my brother?
What is that which waits at your shoulder
and breathes upon your cheek?"
</p>

<p>
At the words Gib, who had listened as
though through force, flung about, but
there was no man beside him.  Then from
the Chippewas went up a little gasp, and
following their eyes I saw a track across
the snow, from the woods leading toward
the ridge, which passed close to us and
right behind Gib.  The track was that of
the Mighty One, the giant moose, and
I realized that The Keeper was taking
advantage of every chance that offered.
</p>

<p>
But Gib laughed harshly.  "The Keeper
is right.  He is on his last trail, unless
he casts away the book in his hand, and
quickly."
</p>

<p>
"Listen, my brothers, while I tell you
a story."  At this I saw Gib start as if
to protest, but a swift glance at the
Chippewas showed that he could not hurry
them.  They were absorbed in watching
The Keeper, and although their admiration
for him would in no degree lessen their
cruelty, they wished to lose nothing of his
words or deeds, for they knew that he
was a greater man than they.  He spoke
slowly, quietly, his weak voice growing
stronger as he went on.
</p>

<p>
"Long ago, when I was a young warrior
without a scalp, a man came among
us.  He wore a black robe.  He was a
white man, and his words were sweet in
our ears.  He told us that the Great Spirit
had sent him among us to tell us that there
should be peace and not war in the land.
</p>

<p>
"My brothers, our old men have told
us that once the hero Hiawatha banded
together five nations in a silver chain of
peace.  These are the five nations of the
Iroquois.  No tribe can stand before
us&mdash;not even the white men have overcome us.
But we have forgotten that we formed a
league of peace, and our arrows are very
sharp.
</p>

<p>
"We listened to the blackrobe, but we
did not believe that the Great Spirit had
sent him to us.  Our medicine men were very
angry at him.  Then there came a plague
upon us, and many of our warriors died
in the villages.  The medicine men said
that the blackrobe had brought the plague
upon us, and our young men cried out
that he should be killed.
</p>

<p>
"My brothers, you do not know how
to torture.  You are women.  We took
the blackrobe to a stake and builded a
fire around him.  Before we lit the fire I
jeered at him, and asked him if his Great
Spirit was stronger than our arrows,
stronger than our fire."
</p>

<p>
There was dead silence, for The Keeper
was holding his audience by the sheer
force of his words, and the Chippewas
were rapt in his story.
</p>

<p>
"My brothers, he answered that his
faith was greater than our fire or our
tomahawks.  We were very glad, for we
knew that he would die like a warrior.  I
myself set the fire around him, but he
seemed to feel no pain.  He gazed up at
the sky and spoke to the Great Spirit as
the coals fell upon him, so that we became
afraid.  And, my brothers, before he died
we heard him ask the Great Spirit to bless
us and not to take vengeance upon us.
Then in truth we knew that his faith was
greater than our fire, and that his Great
Spirit had blunted our arrows.  In the next
year I went to seek out the White Father,
and there I learned to know the Great
Spirit, and I placed his token about my
neck.
</p>

<p>
"My brothers, you have heard my story.
You have asked me to deny the Great
Spirit, but He has whispered to me that He
is stronger than your bows and sharper
than your arrows.  I am sore wounded,
and the end of the trail appears before
me, my brothers.  I have killed many of
your young men, who shall journey with
me on the ghost-trail to find the Great
Spirit.  And when I find Him I will ask
him to bless you.
</p>

<p>
"Brave Eyes," and for an instant the
stern voice faltered, as The Keeper turned
to me, "carry this book to White Eagle, my
father, and tell him that the Chippewas are
women.  Tell him that Ta-cha-noon-tia was
a great warrior, and that I will wait for
him on the Ghost-trail.  Tell the Great
Swift Arrow, my brother, that I will wait
for him also.  Tell them that we have
traveled long together, and that the Great
Spirit has whispered to me that He will
not separate us for long.  My brothers, I
have spoken."
</p>

<p>
Handing the Bible to me, The Keeper
turned and folded his arms calmly.  For a
moment the Chippewas were held under the
spell of his words, then a word from Gib
wakened them.  With all respect they led
The Keeper to a large tree outside the
lodges, and bound him fast.
</p>

<p>
But as for me, I buried my head in my
arms, and sobbed&mdash;great, dry, choking sobs
that I could by no means check nor hinder,
and cared not who saw them.  For I was
alone and helpless, and the bitter agony in
my heart was well-nigh unendurable.
</p>

<p>
So passed Ta-cha-noon-tia, the Keeper
of the Eastern Door&mdash;and never in all the
North was there a passing which so truly
deserved the name of martyrdom.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XVIII.
<br /><br />
HUDSON'S END.
</h3>

<p>
I do not think that this triumph of The
Pike was greatly to his liking, after all.
That speech of The Keeper had staggered
him, and I caught him more than
once, in the hours that followed, gazing
steadfastly at the track of the Mighty One
across the snows.  How that track came
there I know not; the moose must have
passed from the forest to the ridge during
the night without being seen or heard,
which was like enough.
</p>

<p>
So I sat there alone, my head upon my
arms, until the thudding of the arrows had
ceased and a single yell from the Chippewas
told me that it was finished.  No
word or groan had the Mohawk uttered,
and the warriors laid him down beside their
own dead and covered him with his robes
in silent respect.
</p>

<p>
Gib had stood at my side, watching in
stony silence all that passed, and at the
end he turned and strode away, entering
one of the lodges.  The Chippewas left me
to myself, hovering near and conversing
in low tones.  The death of the martyr
had cast a gloom over the day, and I saw
the Cree woman, Laughing Snow, moving
about among the lodges.  For some reason
she had not accompanied us in that mad
flight, but I spared little thought on her.  I
was too full of my grief and rage, for him
who had died.
</p>

<p>
So dragged away an hour or two.  Then
Gib reappeared and said somewhat to his
men, who bestirred themselves promptly.  I
gathered that with the first darkness they
would make an attack on Radisson to
recover Ruth from him, and misdoubted me
much that he could hold the ridge single-handed,
or even the pass itself.  It was not
to be altogether as Gib had planned, however,
for before the afternoon had gone a
murmur of amazement from the Chippewas
awoke me from my lethargy.  Glancing up,
I saw a single figure advancing over the
snows from the ridge.  Halting midway to
us, it stopped and held up both hands, and
I recognized Radisson.
</p>

<p>
Now, at the time, there were only some
eight or nine warriors in camp, the others
having gone forth at Gib's command to
bring in some fresh meat.  Had the others
been here, that which took place had been
next to impossible.  Gib strode out and
shouted to Radisson to come forward without
fear, assuring him of safety, then he
turned back with a swift word.
</p>

<p>
"Bind that white man's hands and gag
him," was his order, and the Chippewas
obeyed.  In a moment I was trussed and
gagged, while Gib flung another blanket
over the still form of The Keeper.  That
he was up to some deviltry I guessed, but
could not fathom his purpose.
</p>

<p>
Radisson slapped along over the snows,
and presently came up to us.  He was
unarmed, and as he paused I could see his
keen eyes searching as if for someone who
was not visible.  It took no great thought
to guess who that someone was, and I
thought he looked puzzled.
</p>

<p>
"Greetings, my brothers," he said
courteously enough, paying no heed to me, but
striding to the fire and warming himself.
The Chippewas replied in kind, and Gib
smiled craftily.
</p>

<p>
"Has White Eagle come to surrender
himself?" returned the renegade softly.
</p>

<p>
Radisson smiled.  "Nay, but to demand
surrender," was his cool retort, and he
turned to the Chippewas, disdaining to
speak with Gib.  "My brothers, the end is
near.  The Great Spirit is fighting against
you.  See, he has led me through the hills
by a secret path, and there on the ridge are
gathered the Cree warriors.  They were
very eager to send their arrows to you, and
I cannot restrain them much longer."
</p>

<p>
This created a little stir among the
Chippewas, but still Gib smiled his
sneering smile.
</p>

<p>
"My brothers, last night you captured
Brave Eyes and one of the Brothers of
the Thunder.  The Yellow Lily was drooping
in your hands, and she has fled to us.
If I let loose my warriors, upon you, they
will eat you up and stamp you into the
earth as the herds of bison stamp the grass.
But return me your prisoners, and we will
go in peace."
</p>

<p>
My heart gave a bound of joy.  So the
Crees had arrived with Swift Arrow!  But
Gib replied calmly enough.
</p>

<p>
"White Eagle, I am not like the fool
Englishmen whom you captured in their
forts single-handed in years past.  I have
not seen your young men, or heard the
sound of their war cries."
</p>

<p>
Radisson turned and pointed out toward
the westering sun that was turning the
snow and hills and trees to crimson and
purple.  A guttural exclamation rose from
the warriors, and Gib's smile faded away;
for there we saw plainly a dozen dark
figures wending toward us and dark against
the sun.
</p>

<p>
"Your road to the west is cut off,"
continued Radisson.  "Your escape is
impossible.  The warriors of Talking Owl
have gathered against you, and if you
would not be overwhelmed at once, you
must act quickly.  These young men come
to join us, and there are others behind
them.  Say, my brothers, will you release
your captives or no?"
</p>

<p>
Beneath the stolid calm of the Chippewas
it needed no sharp eye to see that they
were wild with fear.  Gib's cunning tongue
had failed him for once, and he could
naught but gaze out at the little dots
against the sun.  They were still a mile or
more away, and to detect more than that
they were men was impossible.  In that
moment it seemed that Radisson had
triumphed utterly, and the oldest of the
Chippewas nodded gravely.
</p>

<p>
"My father White Eagle is a great
warrior.  If he will assure us that these
men will do us no harm, will let us go in
peace, and if he will not bring the warriors
of Uchichak upon us, then he may take
his captives.  But Brave Heart must also
be released."
</p>

<p>
"So it shall be," and I detected nothing
of the anxiety that must have underlain
Radisson's calm demeanor.  "These men
shall not harm you, my brothers, and those
who are with me shall not attack you.
Soan-ge-ta-ha shall return home in safety."  Gib
started to utter a bitter protest, but
the Chippewas waved him into silence, and
pulled me to my feet, shoving me forward
to Radisson.  He drew out his knife to
cut my bonds, and asked after The Keeper.
It was Gib who made answer, accepting
the situation.
</p>

<p>
"The Mohawk is out with some of our
young men, Radisson.  He will be back
shortly, and he shall join you then.  Brave
Eyes must remain as he is, lest he attack
us, for he is strong."
</p>

<p>
For an instant Radisson hesitated, and a
swift flash of disappointment ran over his
stern face.  Then it came to me that he
must have played a desperate game, and
vainly I strove to warn him.  The flimsy
excuses of the renegade seemed to be
accepted, however, for without a word he
stepped forward and led me away, none
hindering.
</p>

<p>
When we had gone a hundred yards
from the camp he whipped out his knife,
gave one quick glance to the west, and
cut through my bonds.
</p>

<p>
"Run for it, lad!" he cried.  "Some of
the Chippewa hunters have met the others&mdash;we
are lost unless we break away to the
ridge!"
</p>

<p>
I did not pause to question him, but ran.
For a moment I thought we would be safe
enough, but the Chippewas must have been
watching that party to the west also, for
we had barely started when from the camp
behind went up a shrill yell of rage, and
I heard Gib's shout.
</p>

<p>
I knew without his telling me that he had
tried for one of those audacious coups
which had made his name famous, even as
Gib had said.  The Crees had not arrived;
the party to the west was the party of the
Chippewas who had been left to guard the
retreat, and who for some reason had
come on to join Gib.  Had the hunters
from the camp not met them, in plain sight
of all, we had got clean away.
</p>

<p>
As it was, I was handicapped by having
no snowshoes, but even so I could outrun
the Chippewas, as I knew well.  Then
something whistled over my shoulder, and
a gunshot rang out behind us, and another.
Those Chippewas were well armed, doubtless
from the post, and in their rage at
being tricked so easily they spared no
powder.
</p>

<p>
I dared not try to jump from side to
side, nor could Radisson by reason of his
snowshoes, so we plunged straight for the
ridge.  The bullets whistled past us and
over, and I had just begun to rejoice that
we had escaped, when I saw Radisson stagger
heavily.  Then came wild fear to me,
and I reached his side and caught his arm
in mine.
</p>

<p>
"'Tis naught, Davie," he muttered as
he ran on, and shook me off.  "We have
distanced them&mdash;courage!  Where is The
Keeper?"
</p>

<p>
Before answering I glanced behind.  The
Chippewas had spread out, but were making
no further effort to catch us.  Another
spurt of smoke darted out, and another
bullet sang past faintly.  A hundred yards
farther on and we would be out of range,
so I waited until we had gained it, with
the ridge near ahead.
</p>

<p>
"The Keeper is dead," I answered him
bluntly enough.  "They shot him to death
with arrows at midday."
</p>

<p>
Radisson stopped short and turned a
stricken face to me.  Terrible was that
face, unbelieving my tidings, yet with fear
and horror stamped upon it.  The old man
staggered as he stood, swaying back and
forth, but his eagle-eyes were never
brighter and keener.
</p>

<p>
"Dead?  The Keeper dead?" he repeated
hoarsely.  In a few words I told him all
that had passed.  He bowed his head slowly,
and two great tears trickled down over
his beard, but no more.  When he raised
his countenance again I scarce knew it, so
deep-sunken was it all in a moment, so
ghastly pale.
</p>

<p>
"Come, Davie," he muttered as if his
spirit had broken beneath the weight of
sorrow.  "Swift Arrow has not yet arrived.
We are in bad case, and&mdash;and&mdash;I am
hard hit."
</p>

<p>
I caught him with a cry of grief, but
he gathered himself together and once
more we went on.  My mind was in a whirl,
for I knew the old man was wounded and
badly, yet I was thinking more of his
terrible grief than of his wound.  And so
we came to the ridge again, and when we
reached bare rock Ruth sprang forward
and into my arms, Grim leaping up on me.
</p>

<p>
"Davie&mdash;Davie!" she cried, sobbing,
then lifted her face to mine.  I held her
for an instant, and kissed her on the brow.
But as I looked across her shoulder to
Radisson I bethought me that he was hurt,
and so I loosed her again and would have
gone to him, but he stopped me.
</p>

<p>
"Listen, David!  My strength is sore
spent&mdash;we must leave this cranny in the
rocks for the mouth of the pass, for with
the darkness the Chippewas will be upon
us.  Stop not for talking, lad, but catch
up the muskets and powder and hasten!"
he said.
</p>

<p>
Seeing that it was useless to irritate him
by not obeying, I loaded myself with the
weapons and horns of powder, Ruth helping
me bind on my snowshoes.  Radisson
stood, swaying a little, but gazing at the
rock walls above as if searching for aid.
We set out, Ruth at his arm, and wended
beneath the cliffs toward the mouth of that
valley of shadow through which we had
come hither, striking a path through the
great bowlders strewed around while Grim
followed sedately.  I cast watchful glances
down toward the camp, but Gib seemed to
be waiting for his hunters and for that
second party before he moved on us.  On
a sudden the old wanderer paused, and his
voice rang out as firm as ever.
</p>

<p>
"Look!  The Mighty One has come
again to lead us!"
</p>

<p>
And there in the snow were the tracks
of that gigantic moose, fresh and
new-made, and leading toward the mouth of
the valley!  We followed them as speedily
as might be, and in ten minutes more the
great rock walls had towered above and
closed us in.  Ruth had come to my side
now, and she pressed close to me in fear.
</p>

<p>
The track suddenly turned away from
those old tracks of ours, to one side of the
rocks.  Without hesitation Radisson
followed, until we came to where the moose
had milled around and around in the snow,
possibly to make a bed&mdash;but as Radisson
firmly believed, to point us to something.
And great fear came upon me when Ruth
gave a little cry and showed a long, narrow
cleft in the black rocks at our side.
</p>

<p>
"Said I not that he was leading us?"
cried Radisson triumphantly.  "It is a cave,
lad!  There we can stand off the Chippewas
as long as need be.  Forward!"
</p>

<p>
I took out flint and steel, kindled my
tinder, and presently had a roll of birch
flaring.  Above stretched that cleft in the
granite, silent, black, grim with unseen
terrors.  I led the way gingerly enough, for
the passage seemed to zigzag before me, as
if some giant hand had smitten into the
heart of the cliffs.
</p>

<p>
Then I paused abruptly, holding my flare
high, as the passage opened out.  Surely,
it was a cave&mdash;small, but large enough to
hold us in comfort.  The room was a
dozen feet across and at my feet lay a
little store of wood as if someone else had
been there, while skins were piled in the
corner.  My torch sputtered, and I swiftly
lit the pile of sticks, which flared up
instantly, flickering in a draught.  Then at
the far end of the chamber I saw a second
opening, smaller than the first, and clad in
darkness.
</p>

<p>
"We have an hour," muttered Radisson
thickly, as he sank down upon the skins.
"What is this place?"
</p>

<p>
"Let us tend your wound first," I besought
him, whereat Ruth gave a little cry
and came to his side.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, are you hurt?" she exclaimed
softly, catching his head as he sank back.
"Where is The Keeper?"
</p>

<p>
"He has gone before me," returned
Radisson with more strength.  "Nay, let
be, lass.  You can do me no good now,
for I have come to the end of the trail.
Eat of the food that is left, both of you; we
will have need of all your strength ere
morning, lad."
</p>

<p>
We obeyed him, while Ruth heard the
story of The Keeper's passing, and wept
as she ate until the tears choked her.
Radisson spoke, dry-eyed and smiling, with
Grim curled at his side.
</p>

<p>
"Lad, see what lies in that farther
chamber, for it has taken strong hold on
my mind."
</p>

<p>
Willing to humor him, I caught up a
burning stick and went to the entrance,
which was about mine own height.  All was
dark beyond, until I turned a sharp corner
of the rock.  I near dropped the light, and
my heart leaped in fear, for a great bearded
face was staring out upon me!  Then I
knew all.
</p>

<p>
Staring from across a rude table where
it sat, was the figure of a man&mdash;in one
hand an ancient pistol, in the other a quill,
with paper before it.  Upon the table sat
a keg, with the word "Hudson" painted
on it, and I needed not to look at that high
brow encased in the frozen drippings from
the rock above, to know that here had been
the ending of Henry Hudson.

CHAPTER XIX.
<br /><br />
THE MIGHTY ONE.
</h3>

<p>
"What is it, Davie?" called the
soft voice of Ruth, awaking me
from my horrified stupor.
</p>

<p>
"Wait," I made hoarse answer, still
dazed by my startling discovery.  Looking
closer at that figure before me, I saw that
it was as if cased in ice, and as something
splashed on my neck I knew that the
rock-drippings from above had covered it.  With
trembling fingers I wiped the sweat from
my brow, then caught at the sheet of paper
before me and incontinently fled.
</p>

<p>
The horror of it unnerved me, and must
have shown in my face.  Gradually I told
the others of what I had seen, and Radisson
started up on his elbow, his old face alight
with a great amazement and joy.
</p>

<p>
"The paper, lad&mdash;the paper!" he cried
out.  "Hendrik Hudson&mdash;ah, but this is the
greatest discovery of all!  Naught matters
now&mdash;for I have goodly company on the
Ghost-trail!  Read the paper, lad!"
</p>

<p>
I held down the dry paper&mdash;for it seemed
to have escaped those drippings, by some
trick of Fate&mdash;to the light, and with Ruth
peering over my shoulder made shift to
read the words written there in English.
It was in the same hand which had written
in the Bible, and the two lie here before
me now.  It seemed to be one of other
sheets, for at the top it was numbered in
Roman.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="quote">
"XI
<br />
shall beeware how you doe deal my
Truste.  In Time shall come Them
of mine own Race, to whom doe I
graunt all thyngs Herein.  This bee
a rich laund &amp; worthe ye keeping for
Britain.  Soe now farewell.  I grow
weak.
<br /><br />
Henry Hudson."
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
I looked up from the paper amazed, and
met the exultant eyes of Radisson fixed
upon me.  The old man clutched at the
scrap and held it to him fiercely.
</p>

<p>
"Radisson has won again!" he exclaimed,
his dark eyes shining bright.  "I
have found a new country and with it
Henry Hudson&mdash;ah, get you outside, lad!
Take the fusils with you, and keep guard!
I had forgot our danger, and the night
must be coming on.  They will trail us
here, for The Pike must know the place.
Yet it is strange that he knew naught of
the passage through the hills behind!"
</p>

<p>
I loaded the fusils afresh and left
him in the care of Ruth.  When I gained
the entrance to the cave I saw that it must
have fallen dark outside, yet the mouth of
the passage from the ridge was lit by the
fires in the sky, which seemed faintly
ablaze.  As I set down the guns and drew
my furs about me, shivering in the bitterness
of the cold, I was thankful that at
least I was sheltered from that great wind
that tore down through the gap moaning
and shrieking.
</p>

<p>
Where had that moose-track come from?
It seemed hard to believe that the mighty
animal had passed from woods to ridge,
and so on into the passage without having
been seen by any.  Yet it must have been
even so, for the trail was a fresh one, and
I wondered at the thing.
</p>

<p>
With it all I was mightily afraid, nor
hesitated to admit it to myself.  The death
of The Keeper had been a great shock to
me, and the finding of Hudson, the mere
knowing that his earthly form lay in that
cave behind me, was horrible.  The
fearsomeness of that passageway through the
cliffs, lying so dark and ghostly in front
of me, added in no small degree to my
shakings of soul.
</p>

<p>
And to cap all, Radisson lay stricken
mortally.  This I guessed from his manner
of speaking and from the fact that he
would not allow us to care for his wound.
The great wonder of the whole thing, from
the trail of the Mighty One to the
martyrdom of the Mohawk, oppressed me, and
I remembered how The Keeper had prophesied
that he would not go on the spirit-trail
alone.
</p>

<p>
Then I fell to thinking of Hudson.
So the little boat had not been lost, as all
men had thought, but had reached land.  Who
might know the tale of all that had
happened?  The stout seaman must have seen
his friends and his son perish one by one,
yet have struggled on to the west until he
had come to the Ghost Hills and found
there the rest denied him in life.
</p>

<p>
So I sat there half in dream, thinking
bitterly on what was to be the end of it all.
For myself I cared little, but I could not
see Ruth in red hands.  Why did not
Swift Arrow and Uchichak arrive?  Almost
on the thought, it seemed that a dark
shadow flitted down through the pass,
whereat I caught up one of the guns and
cried out.
</p>

<p>
"It is Ca-yen-gui-ha-no," came the
voice of the Mohawk.  "Where is my
brother?"
</p>

<p>
"Here," I shouted, great relief in my
heart, and had like to fling my arms about
the tall old man as he clambered up to me.
"But Uchichak&mdash;where are the Crees?
We are in sore need, Swift Arrow!"
</p>

<p>
"They come," he grunted in surprise as
he saw where I stood.  "The Mighty One
met us.  I fired and drove him back.  The
Crees are slow.  Swift Arrow came on
quickly, and passed the Mighty One, who
follows behind me."
</p>

<p>
He peered about, and I motioned him
back into the cave, whither he vanished.
A moment later there came a yell from the
mouth of the gap, and I knew that the
Chippewas were upon me.  A number of
dark shapes flitted across the opening, a
hundred paces away, and I fired at one
of these, the echoes rolling up and up in
weird echoes of sound.
</p>

<p>
"Let my brother load," and Swift Arrow
stood beside me again.  "I will shoot."
</p>

<p>
Cheerfully enough I resigned my place
to him.  Now came two shots, and the bullets
pattered on the cliffs behind.  But to
reach us the Chippewas would have to
cross that open gully where lay the deep,
hard snow, and even in the half-light from
the closed-out skies their figures would show
plainly against the white snow.  And we
had four guns, with a good store of powder
and balls close to hand.
</p>

<p>
After those first shots, there came no
sign of danger, but I knew that the cunning
brain of The Pike would not rest idle
for long.  The Chippewas could not reach
us from below without making a straight
charge, which they would have little
stomach for, and they could not get
at us from above, since those high walls of
granite could hardly be scaled.
</p>

<p>
Yet Gib solved the problem, for presently
a musket roared over against us on the
opposite side of the cliffs, and a bullet
whistled into the cleft behind.  There was
no danger that those within the cavern
could be injured, by reason of the twists
in the passage, but the mouth of the cave
where we lay could be raked easily enough,
and the Arrow grunted.
</p>

<p>
"We must hit or be hit, Brave Eyes,"
and he laid his fusil in rest, aiming at the
place whence had come the flash.  A
moment later it came again, but the Arrow
fired almost with it.  A single yell echoed
up, and thereafter came no more shots
from across the way.
</p>

<p>
"Think you they will try to rush upon
us?" I whispered fearfully.
</p>

<p>
"They are women," he grunted disdainfully.
"The Mighty One will scatter them."
</p>

<p>
"How mean you?  Where is the moose?"
</p>

<p>
"He is near.  The Crane will drive him
before, and when he comes the Chippewas
will scatter from before him."
</p>

<p>
Then I remembered what the Mohawk
had first said, upon his arrival.  He had
met the moose traveling toward the open
country, and had driven him back toward
us, passing him later as he hurried on
ahead of the Crees.  But soon I had other
things to bother my head with than the
moose.
</p>

<p>
For as we lay watching, something came
down from the skies and shattered on the
rocks beside me.  Feeling about, I found
that it had been an arrow, and now we
were in grave danger indeed.  If we
withdrew under the shelter of the cave, we
would lose sight of that open gully
beneath us; but if we lay there without
covering above, the Chippewa arrows could
descend full upon us.  Gib was having
his men shoot straight up, so that the
arrows would fall with fearful force, and
against such shooting we were defenseless.
</p>

<p>
They pattered down all around, shattering
on the rock and yet seeming to miss
us altogether.  Before long the Mohawk,
who had refused to listen to my word that
we should seek shelter inside the cave and
defend its mouth, began to chant something
in a low voice that swelled louder and
louder.  A wild, barbaric chant it was, in
words that I knew not, but ever and anon
he would lift one of the fusils and shoot,
though I could see no object at which to
aim.  When his chant died down again
I asked him the meaning of it.
</p>

<p>
"I go on the Ghost-trail, my brother,"
he responded after a moment.  "The
Chippewa arrows are very sharp, and the
Great Spirit has called me.  I hear the
voice of the Keeper of the Eastern Door.
He asks me why I wait.  I am waiting for
my father the White Eagle, oh
Ta-cha-noon-tia!"  With which he trailed off into
his own tongue once more and paid no
further heed to me.
</p>

<p>
I knew not whether he had been struck
with one of those falling arrows, for he had
made no sign.  A moment later he pressed
a fusil into my hands.
</p>

<p>
"They come, brother!  Be ready!"
</p>

<p>
I loaded it as rapidly as might be, but
had not finished when a great yell went
up from the darkness, and across the snow
came the Chippewas&mdash;dark splotches that
seemed to leap over the white ground.
</p>

<p>
The Arrow waited, and then when they
seemed to be almost upon us, he began
firing.  One after another of the foremost
figures went down, and I managed to get
the first gun to him as he fired the fourth.
Before that rain of lead the Chippewas
broke and fled, but I heard the voice of
Gib ring out, and knew that he was still
unharmed.  When the muskets were once
more loaded, I left the ledge for an instant,
and ran back to the cave, in order to
reassure Ruth.  I found her and Radisson
just as I had left them, on the pile of
skins, and although the fire had died down,
there was plenty of wood in the cave from
which to replenish it.  In a few words I
told them of the repulse.
</p>

<p>
"And Swift Arrow?" demanded Radisson
quickly.  "Why was he singing the
death-chant?  Is he also hurt?
</p>

<p>
"I know not," was my hesitating answer,
and the tears could not be kept back&mdash;nor
were they the tears of a boy.  "He is
waiting for you, he said."
</p>

<p>
"Ah!  Then he will not have long to wait,
methinks," Radisson breathed, holding the
hand of Ruth.  At sight of Grim I
bethought me that he might well prove of
service, and so I called him to follow me
out to the front of the cave.
</p>

<p>
"Ready!" thrilled a sharp whisper from
Swift Arrow, who had the guns close to
his hand.  Grim growled.  This time the
attack came with no forewarning until we
saw the approach of the Chippewas, creeping
stealthily forward through the snow.
But as they came, arrows pattered around
us from those behind, who covered their
advance.
</p>

<p>
And this time, there was no stopping
them.  Five times did the Arrow fire,
but then came a rush, and he had but time
to draw his knife and put his tomahawk
ready.  I caught up one of the heavy fusils
and swung it about my head, and then they
were upon us&mdash;a mad swirl of men who
seemed to spring out of the darkness and
up the path to our ledge.
</p>

<p>
Now, when it came to hand-to-hand fighting,
my great strength proved its worth.  The
Arrow had crawled to my side, and as only
one or two men could reach us at a time,
we managed to fling them back with
gun-butt and tomahawk, while the shrill yell
of the Mohawk rose madly over the shrieks
of the Chippewas.
</p>

<p>
Time after time my heavy piece rose and
fell, sometimes parried and sometimes not,
while at my side glittered the steel of the
old chief, rapid and deadly; but ever the
voice of Gib urged on the warriors, and
ever they pressed up that narrow path in
mad resolve.  On a sudden I felt a sharp
pain in my shoulder, and the fusil dashed
out of my hands against the rock wall as I
staggered back.
</p>

<p>
An instant, and I had pulled out the
knife with a shudder of pain, but that
instant had been well-nigh fatal, for the
Chippewas poured over us.  Then, while
I was still faint with the shock and the
pain came Grim to the fore.  Swift Arrow
had risen to his feet, still plying his
deadly steel desperately, when the great
sheep-dog crouched and sprang, snarling
and tearing in the midst of them beneath us.
</p>

<p>
The Chippewas fell back before him
in wild affright, leaving two of their
number at handgrips with us.  One of these
went down under the knife of the Mohawk;
the other I seized by the throat and dashed
back against the rock, where he lay silent.
Then I whistled sharp and shrill, and Grim
came back to me&mdash;bleeding and torn, but
still not hurt unto death.  So near had
they come to taking us, that but for him
we had assuredly perished.
</p>

<p>
But the Chippewas had not retreated
far, and the evil tones of Gib showed me
where he stood out there on the snow.  The
Arrow had fallen forward against the rock,
helpless; when next they charged, his aid
would be of no avail.  And the blood was
running fast from my shoulder, as I
reloaded one of the weapons.
</p>

<p>
Gib was standing out in the center of
the pass, and of a sudden I heard what
seemed to be a bellow of rage, followed
by a wild shriek from the Chippewas.
Turning, I saw a mighty form leaping
through the darkness&mdash;great horns
outspread, giant shoulders rising high over
the group of warriors, huge hoofs striking
to right and left.  In the dim light, I
thought I saw Gib raise a musket, and for
an instant the flash of it showed me the
Mighty One himself, poised high in air
as he leaped upon the terror-struck men.
</p>

<p>
Then all went dark again.  One horrible,
long-drawn shriek wailed out down the
great cliffs as I raised my musket and
aimed at the huge shape below, from which
men fled every way.  I fired, and saw it
stumble forward over a smaller form in
the snow; then I felt the faintness of my
wound come upon me again, and had but
strength enough to stagger back through
the cave, meet the staring eyes of Radisson,
and fall at the feet of Ruth.  But as
I fell, I heard from without the war-cry
of Uchichak, and knew that the Mighty
One had saved us; then I fell asleep, with
the tongue of Grim hot on my cheek.

<h3>
CHAPTER XX.
<br /><br />
HOW PIERRE RADISSON SLEPT.
</h3>

<p>
When I woke, it was in the midst
of a grave silence.  That may
scarce mean sense, yet to the full
it expresses the feeling that came upon
me when I opened my eyes and looked
about me.  I was sitting against the cave
wall, Ruth at my side, and Grim, his great
honest dog's eyes full of pain, crouching
and looking up at me.
</p>

<p>
Now the little cave was full of light and
men&mdash;Uchichak and other chiefs of the
Crees, who were standing silent before me,
while the light smoke from the dry wood
drove past us in the draught.  Ruth was
bathing my face with water, but I pushed
her hand away.  This silence among so
many boded ill, and oppressed me strangely.
I remembered Radisson, and sought for
him through the crowding forms.
</p>

<p>
He was sitting against the wall, with
the Swift Arrow at his side, their hands
clasped.  But, although the Mohawk was
well-nigh gone, never had Radisson's face
seemed happier, younger and nobler.  Hope
leaped into my heart that he had not been
as sore stricken as we had thought.
</p>

<p>
Ruth helped me to my feet.  We went
over and sat beside him.  His hand closed
on ours, and he smiled kindly on Ruth.
</p>

<p>
"Well does the Great Swift Arrow deserve
his name," he said softly, so that the
dying eyes of the old chief lit up.  "He
brought Uchichak to us and sped on ahead
of him, and so saved us all."
</p>

<p>
"Then you are not so badly hurt?" I
exclaimed joyfully.  Radisson chuckled,
and made answer in his old rich, laughing
voice.
</p>

<p>
"Hurt?  Why, lad, I have triumphed!
The Keeper, the Swift Arrow and I will
travel the last trail together ere long, but
see!"  And he waved the paper of Hudson
aloft as might a boy, then his eyes went
to the Cree chiefs, and he spoke in their
own tongue.
</p>

<p>
"My brothers, White Eagle goes upon
the spirit-trail.  But first he would tell you
that in the days to come, white men shall
arrive among you.  Do not make war upon
them, my brothers.  They will trade with
you for your furs, and will bring much
good to you.  Will you remember this?"
</p>

<p>
"We will remember," answered The
Crane gravely, and a murmur passed
around among the other chiefs.  The head
of Swift Arrow suddenly sank forward and
his hand dropped from that of Radisson.
The Mohawk had not waited.
</p>

<p>
Radisson's face never changed as he
asked the Crees how the fight had gone,
and if Gib had been slain, and then drew
Ruth and me down to him while he waited
the answer.
</p>

<p>
"My father," said Uchichak slowly, "the
Crees did not fight, for the enemy had gone.
The Mighty One had fought for us and
scattered them.  But&mdash;" and he hesitated
an instant, "as we came near, a gun was
fired from the cave, and lightning shot
across the snow.  When we had sought the
Chippewas, we found the Mighty One lying
dead, and beneath his hoofs was the form
of The Pike."
</p>

<p>
Uchichak paused.  With a little shudder
I remembered how I had seen the giant
moose uprearing and striking out with
hoofs and horns, and how he had stumbled
across a man even as I fired.  Ruth
was sobbing quietly on Radisson's shoulder,
and the old wanderer addressed us in
English.
</p>

<p>
"Children, do not grieve.  I am an old
man, and have lived through more than
most men.  As for Gib, he has perished by
the hand of God, even as I foretold that
he would.  Now listen carefully.
</p>

<p>
"You, Ruth, are of right named Marie
de Courbelles.  It were best to visit
Montreal and Quebec, for there live your
father's people, though he is dead long
since, and there you may obtain your
inheritance, which is a goodly one."
</p>

<p>
Ruth sobbed out that she wanted none
of it, whereat the old man petted her head
and smiled on me suddenly.
</p>

<p>
"Davie, you will care for the little
maid?"
</p>

<p>
"An' she will let me, I will," was my
low reply.
</p>

<p>
"Then I shall pass happy," and Radisson
sighed as if a burden was off his mind.
"I would that you had the old Bible of
which you spoke, lass.  I would like to
hear once more the story of those days
Christ spent in the wilderness.  It hath
ever attracted me strangely&mdash;I would that
my days had been set where I might have
known Him!"
</p>

<p>
And as Radisson voiced the age-old wish
of the world, I bethought me that I still
had the packet which The Keeper had put
in my hands, and so drew it out hastily.
</p>

<p>
"I have it here&mdash;read it, Ruth!"
</p>

<p>
The little maid took the Book with trembling
hands.  The translation was Englished
by Wicliff, and when she had found the
place she put it into French again for
Radisson.  He listened gravely, his head
drooping while she read, the stately chiefs
standing around in silent attention, though
they understood it not.  When it was
finished he sighed again.
</p>

<p>
"Thanks, my daughter.  Brave Eyes,
help me to my feet, for I would fain look
upon the face of Hudson ere I pass."
</p>

<p>
With The Crane, I helped him to gain
his feet, and he leaned heavily upon us.  I
motioned Ruth not to follow, for that sight
was none for her eyes, and so we led him
through the inner passage to the second
chamber where sat the great mariner in
his eternal silence.  The glow from our
torch lit up his face, and Radisson sank
down against the table.
</p>

<p>
"Henry Hudson and Pierre Radisson!"
I heard him murmur.  "It were a fitting
ending, and a noble one!"  Pulling himself
up, he signed to us that we should help
him back again, which we did, nothing
loath.  Uchichak was trembling when we
reached the outer cave, for that man who
sat with quill in hand had frighted him
mightily.  Yet Radisson had been more
observing than I, for all his weakness.
</p>

<p>
"Davie," he said, more faintly, when he
was again sitting upon the skins, "I wish
that you do one more thing for me.  When
I have entered upon the spirit-trail, then
carry me into that chamber and let me
sit at the table over against Henry Hudson.
Place there The Keeper and The Swift
Arrow also, for such greatness is worthy
them.
</p>

<p>
"That keg upon the table holds powder,
I think.  When we are placed, lad, do you
set that keg of powder in the narrow
entrance and&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
He went no farther, for Ruth fell upon
his neck with a great cry.  But he knew
that I had understood, and that I would
obey.  Nothing could better show the
fantastic, grim spirit of the old wanderer
than this last desire of his&mdash;to be tombed
in the living rock, with Henry Hudson and
the two Mohawks beside him.  Nor, as I
think now, was it so mad a wish after all;
for what better tomb could Pierre Radisson
have, in all this land he had found and
loved and given to the world?
</p>

<p>
Now, since we had to pass the night
here at least, I had the body of Swift
Arrow carried within the second chamber.
The Crees had already formed a camp outside,
and as Radisson wished to taste fresh
meat once more before he passed&mdash;for we
had gone hungry of late, through having
brought little food with us&mdash;I went outside
with Uchichak.  The Cree camp was in a
place sheltered from the terrific, howling
wind, and as the fires in the sky had now
risen high overhead and sent down a
ghostly light into the deep gulch, I was
enabled to see the Mighty One where he
lay&mdash;for the Indians had not dared to touch
him.
</p>

<p>
That last chance shot of mine had
pierced through his heart, striking him just
behind the shoulder and going true.  And
what a great beast he was!  I had shot
moose ere this, with my arrows, and had
seen full many, but never so huge a beast
as this Mighty One.  Still beneath his great
body lay Gib o' Clarclach, his evil face
untouched and grinning its last defiant grin
up at the sky which he had blasphemed.
</p>

<p>
In that moment I was glad that no blow
of mine had laid him low.  He had lived
wrongly, and died wrongly.  What a
contrast between his death and that of The
Keeper!  Yet the white man was of a race
which we call superior, he knew of things
which the Mohawk had never dreamed of,
he had had advantages which The Keeper
could never have had&mdash;and he had lost his
soul alive.  Nay, I am not judging him,
God forbid!  It may be that even such as
he are not without hope elsewhere.
</p>

<p>
Uchichak plucked up his courage and
together we cut off the choicest portions
of the giant moose and carried them over
to the fires of the camp in the shelter of
the walls.  Many of the Crees had gone
on to the lodges, there to rescue Laughing
Snow and to await the coming of Talking
Owl from the western pass.
</p>

<p>
When the meat was cooked I carried it
back to the cavern, where we found Radisson
as we had left him, and but for his
weakness I had never known that he was
hurt.  He seemed to have become twenty
years younger in an hour.
</p>

<p>
Only Uchichak and one of two of the
older chiefs had remained with us.  We all
partook of the meat, and I even forced a
portion upon Ruth, who was in sore need
of it.  She, poor girl, had little heart for
eating, but managed to do well enough,
as did we all.
</p>

<p>
"Now let us consider," said Radisson,
to whom the meal had given strength.
Not even when he was facing death would
he give up planning.  "How are you to
reach home again?"
</p>

<p>
"We have no home," said Ruth sadly.
</p>

<p>
"Ayrby is sold, and we may not return."
</p>

<p>
"Tut, child," he responded.  "I make
no doubt you can get the farm back again,
if so you wish.  Once I am gone, neither
English nor French will molest you.
Indeed, you might make for the nearest
post and there take ship for the colonies.
I would have you visit Montreal, if
possible, and there regain the inheritance
which awaits you.  There will be ships
in the Bay from Boston, mayhap, who will
set forth in the spring."
</p>

<p>
Straight upon this there entered four
warriors who bore the silent form of The
Keeper.  Radisson demanded to look upon
the face of his friend once more, and I
would have drawn Ruth aside, but she
would not.  And when The Keeper's face
was uncovered, I was glad that this was
so; for the noble old face was strangely
exalted and lit with a great beauty such
as never in all my life had I seen.  I
cannot describe it fittingly, yet it was a
memory that has ever-remained fresh and
vivid&mdash;as if God's hand had touched
the worn features lightly, ere they fell
into the repose of death.
</p>

<p>
Then they covered him again and bore
him into the inner chamber, where they
stayed no longer than might be.  The old
wanderer, I could see, was now sinking fast,
and his hand would tremble as it clutched
mine and Ruth's.  Presently he pulled
from about his neck a gold medal&mdash;the
same, it proved, that had been given him
long years before by the English king, ere
his shameful betrayal.  This he pressed
into Ruth's hand.
</p>

<p>
"Here, my daughter&mdash;keep this in my
memory, and with my blessing.  It is a poor
thing to remember me by, and yet it is all
I have; it is the sole trace of honor that
has come to me for all my labors, and I
would that you keep it alway."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, we need naught to remember&mdash;"
began Ruth, but ended in a sob.  Perhaps to
check her grief, Radisson asked her to
read to him from the Book, and so she
took it up again and after a little began
to read, while the tears ran over her
cheeks.  Whether by accident or by
design she never told me, but the passage
was that wherein the prophet met and
spoke with his God upon the mountain.
</p>

<p>
I watched Radisson as she read, and saw
his face light up, then the look passed into
one of awe and wonder.  Slowly his head
bowed down, until I checked Ruth with
my hand, for I thought that the end had
come; but it was not so, for he signed
to her to continue, and raised his head once
more, looking up at the roof of the cave
with startled eyes, as though he saw there
more than the bare rock.  And with that
he stretched out his arm, and I helped him
to his feet.  He shook me off and took
one step forward alone.
</p>

<p>
"Not in the whirlwind," he cried
passionately, his voice ringing deep echoes
from all around, "not in the whirlwind,
O Lord, nor in the fire, nor in the storm
have I found Thee!  But in the&mdash;still&mdash;small&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
He swayed forward, all the life gone out
of him suddenly, and when I lowered him
to the skins I knew that Radisson had
departed upon the spirit-trail.  I signed to
The Crane, and we carried him into the
inner chamber and seated him across the
table from Hudson.  Then&mdash;for I knew
that in the morning no power would tempt
me to enter that room again&mdash;I carried out
the keg, which proved to be nearly full of
coarse, dry powder, and left it in the
passage.
</p>

<p>
"Come," said Ruth, catching at my arm,
"we will sleep out by the fire.  Here
I&mdash;I cannot, Davie."
</p>

<p>
I held her to me for a moment, then
told The Crane to lead her to the fire.
When she had gone I gathered up the skins
and furs, and after a little time we had
fixed up a shelter for her in a cranny of
the rocks, where I left her.  I rejoined the
silent Crees and flung myself down in the
warmth of the fire to sleep, for I was very
weary.
</p>

<p>
The day was high when I wakened.
Ruth, it seemed, was still asleep.  In the
early morning the band of Talking Owl
had arrived, and with Uchichak's warriors
had swept away those that remained of the
Chippewas.  The days of the band were
over; few ever returned to their villages,
and those that did bore with them such a
tale as kept Chippewa hunters in their
own country for many winters to come.
</p>

<p>
My first duty before Ruth was up, was
to clear away all signs of conflict.  Gib and
his dead were laid to rest in the outer
cave, decently enough.  The giant moose
had already been quartered and the great
antlers were preserved for me as trophies.
So when Ruth appeared, naught remained
of the struggle save the trampled snow
and a few shattered fragments of arrows.
</p>

<p>
The Crees were anxious to be home
again, having raided the lodges in the basin
and burned them.  So without delay I
whistled Grim and entered the cave.
Placing the keg of powder in the narrowest
part of the entrance, I set a long train
with a final fuse of birch bark.  When all
was ready I warned off the curious Crees
and lit the bark with a stick from the fire.
</p>

<p>
For a moment it blazed up, and when
I had turned from my hasty flight I saw
only a tiny flicker of flame from the
powder.  Then came a cloud of smoke from
the entrance, a low, thunderous roar that
reverberated from the high cliffs overhead,
and the great rocks crashed down in utter
ruin.  The cave was no more.  Pierre
Radisson slept with those whom he had
chosen for company in his last long sleep.

<h3>
CHAPTER XXI.
<br /><br />
THE SHADOW OF THE CROSS.
</h3>

<p>
With saddened hearts we turned our
faces toward the Barren Places
once again.  Swift Arrow had
killed two of the dogs in his dash for
help, but the others were sufficient to draw
the sled bearing Grim and Ruth.  The old
dog's wounds had become too stiff and sore
to permit of his traveling afoot, so he
curled up at Ruth's feet.
</p>

<p>
The antlers of the Mighty One were
lashed to the sled behind the little maid,
forming a rest for her to lean back upon.
My wound did not prevent traveling, and
there was no great need of haste.  A band
of the warriors pushed on to provide food
for us who followed, and at length we
emerged from that dismal, howling passage
through the cliffs into the frozen silence
of the desolate wastes.
</p>

<p>
Not until the second evening did we
reach the village once more.  On the journey
I initiated Uchichak into the mysteries
of a musket, for although the Crees had
often seen our guns and knew their uses,
they had never heard them fired until that
shot wherewith I killed the Mighty One.
The chief was delighted with the weapon
which I gave to him, as were the other
chiefs, for I kept only one fusil for my
own use.
</p>

<p>
At the village the party of Talking Owl
remained for a great feast.  On the second
evening of this feast a great council was
held of the two bands, for so Ruth had
urged upon me that day.
</p>

<p>
"We must not forget, Davie, that our
task is not finished here," she said gravely,
as we were discussing what we had best
do.  "See if you can get them to admit
me to a Council again, to read to them from
the Book.  I can put it into Cree, I think."
</p>

<p>
So we crowded into the lodge of council
in the evening, and among others who were
admitted was Soan-ge-ta-ha the Chippewa.
The destruction of his band and the death
of Gib seemed to have broken the old chief,
and he had readily agreed to return home in
peace and to lead no more war-parties into
the Ghost Hills.  Three of the foremost
seats, however, were left empty out of
respect, while from the top of the lodge was
suspended the great pair of antlers which
the giant moose had borne.  The first who
addressed the Council was Uchichak, when
the calumet had been ceremoniously passed
around, Brave Heart accepting it in silence.
</p>

<p>
"My brothers," he began gravely, "once
before has Yellow Lily been admitted to
the Council.  Then she told us about the
Great Spirit and His Son, and about the
Book, of which we understood little.  But
in the Ghost Hills, my brothers, she found
this same paper-talk, sent to her by the
Great Spirit, and she wishes that we should
hear it.
</p>

<p>
"My brothers, I am old.  I have seen
the Mighty One fall under the hand of
Brave Eyes.  I do not know whether our
Great Spirit sent him or not, but we
decreed in Council that if he slew the Mighty
One, then would we listen to his Great
Spirit."
</p>

<p>
Uchichak resumed his seat.  Talking
Owl and his chiefs, who had of course
heard the tale of the previous Council,
objected to allowing Ruth or any other
woman to enter the lodge.  They were,
however, overruled, and finally assented.
</p>

<p class="capcenter">
<a id="img-090"></a>
<img class="imgcenter" src="images/img-090.jpg" alt="She selected parts of the Gospels--The chiefs understood and listened absorbedly." />
<br />
<i>She selected parts of the Gospels&mdash;The chiefs <br />
understood and listened absorbedly.</i>
</p>

<p>
When Ruth entered, she stood beside the
fire so that the flickering light would enable
her to read from the little Book.  I had
not known what portion she would give to
them, but she started with the Creation,
wisely enough.  Then she selected parts
of the Gospels which gave short sketches
from the life of the Master, and concluded
with the great story of Saint Paul.  She
turned the whole into Cree as she went,
stumbling in places where she knew no
words, altering other parts to simpler
language, but on the whole the chiefs
understood and listened absorbedly.  They
were little more than children in spirit,
loving a story for its own sake, but
over-quick to catch the sense of a parable, so
that Ruth read them many of these.
</p>

<p>
It was a lengthy reading, and when it
was done I had thought the chiefs were
asleep but for their glittering eyes centered
on the little maid.  When I had led her
out and come back to my seat there was a
very long silence, until at last the oldest
chief stepped out and made the smoke-offering
to the four corners of the heavens.
</p>

<p>
"My brothers, there were four chiefs
who sat in the Council, and who defied the
Mighty One, saying that he was not sent by
the Great Spirit to us his children.  My
eyes are very feeble, yet I see only one of
these four.  There are three vacant places
before me.  Perhaps White Eagle and the
Brothers of the Thunder have not yet
come?"
</p>

<p>
His gaze swept around as if looking for
the absent ones, but none answered.
</p>

<p>
"My brothers, I see before me Brave
Eyes, whose name shall be Moose-slayer
hereafter.  Over his head swing the horns
of the Mighty One.  I am too old to take
the war-trail, and my limbs are feeble.
Perhaps Moose-slayer will tell me how the
Mighty One was slain."
</p>

<p>
A whisper of approval passed around as
he sat down, and after a little the eyes of
the chiefs were fixed upon me, waiting.  So,
when the silence had become unendurable,
I came to my feet and faced them.
</p>

<p>
Painting the picture before them as well
as I might, for so they love to have their
stories told, I related how The Keeper had
died beneath the Chippewa arrows, a martyr
to his faith, and retold his words.  Then
on to the fight at the cavern and the silent
man whom we had found sitting therein,
and I laid emphasis on how the little Bible
had been his, telling them something of his
life.  I concluded the whole by reciting
the death of the Mighty One, which had
brought me the high honor of a new name.
I urged naught upon them, merely pointing
out how the Great Spirit had directed my
bullet to its mark, and so made an end of
speaking.  I could tell that my words had
impressed them, but I did not know how
deeply until Uchichak arose.
</p>

<p>
"My brothers, we have listened to the
Yellow Lily, we have heard the words of
Moose-slayer," for such is the best
translation I can give of the Cree term applied
to me.  "I have never met the dead, my
brothers, yet in the paper-talk the Great
Spirit has said that we should meet them
upon the spirit-trail.  I would like to meet
White Eagle once again, and my father
Gray Fish, and my other friends and
kinsmen.  Our hearts are open; but first I
would listen to the words of Talking Owl."
</p>

<p>
The latter chief, who was gaunt and
hollow-eyed, surprised me greatly by his
words.
</p>

<p>
"There can be but one Great Spirit, my
brothers.  The Crane has told you that our
hearts are open, and it is true.  The
Mighty One was very strong.  Our young
men dared not stand against him, and our
old men said that he was a messenger from
the Great Spirit.  We believed that this
was true.
</p>

<p>
"Then came this white man to our villages.
We hunted with him, and we found
that his tongue was straight.  When he told
The Crane that the Mighty One was not
sent by the Great Spirit and that he would
hunt the moose, we were sorry, for we
loved him and we loved White Eagle his
brother.  The Chippewas, my brothers,
believed in our Great Spirit, yet the Mighty
One attacked and scattered them, and the
white man slew him in a moment.  Talking
Owl thinks that the Great Spirit of the
white man and the Great Spirit of the red
man are the same, and that He has sent
Moose-slayer as a messenger to us."
</p>

<p>
With that I knew that the cause was
won.  The Council lasted a great while
longer, each of the older chiefs speaking
in turn while the warriors listened, but
they all agreed with Uchichak and Talking
Owl, and in the end it was decided that
they should accept the "sign in the water"
at another council to be held the next night.
</p>

<p>
I hastened back to Ruth with the good
news, and she was mightily rejoiced.  As
it was late, we made no preparations until
the next day.  The Crees had decided that
Soan-ge-ta-ha should return scatheless to
his people, but somewhat to my surprise the
Chippewa announced that he, too, would
receive the "sign in the water" with the
Cree chiefs.  This was more than we had
looked for, and it greatly strengthened our
influence, for Brave Heart was a famous
chief in his own nation.
</p>

<p>
So in the great council-lodge we met and
there the chiefs and warriors received
baptism.  I felt keenly mine own unworthiness
in the matter, but for this there was no
help.  The squaws could by no means enter
this lodge, and so we visited them outside
by the light of great fires, afterward
returning to the Council.  There I set before
them all, the fact that it was time that Ruth
and I returned to our own people.
</p>

<p>
"The spirit of White Eagle will be very
happy," I told them, "as he looks down
and sees that you also are followers of the
Great Spirit, my brothers.  And now that
we have fulfilled our mission, we would
fain depart.  First, however, I bid you to
send messengers to all the other villages,
and cement a League of Peace here in the
northland, a silver chain of peace which
shall bind you together strongly.  You shall
have a council from all your tribes and
villages which shall rule you justly, and if this
be done there shall no war or danger come
upon you for ever.  I would fain stay and
see that this is done rightly, yet I am far
from mine own people and my home, and
the trail is a long one to follow."
</p>

<p>
As you may imagine, Uchichak and the
rest were in huge consternation at this, but
in the end they promised to follow my
advice and form a peace-league among the
peoples of the snows.  Whether this was
ever done I know not to this day.
</p>

<p>
As to the manner of our return, few of
the Crees hereabouts had ever visited the
shores of the Great Bay, for the trail led
across the Barren Places and their hunting
grounds lay rather to the west and south.
Soan-ge-ta-ha, however, offered to guide us
to one of the posts as soon as we should
come to the Chippewa country, and this
offer we accepted right willingly.
</p>

<p>
Talking Owl and his warriors remained
a few days longer for a last grand hunt,
and a dozen Crees, with Uchichak,
arranged to accompany us to the Chippewa
country.  When the time of parting came,
I told them that if possible I would send
other messengers to them from the Great
Spirit, who should tell them more of Him
than could I; but I laid no great weight
upon this promise, knowing the men who
made up the Adventurers, and indeed the
first to come among them with the Word
after our leaving, were missionaries from
the Canadas.
</p>

<p>
So once more we turned our backs upon
friends and faced, this time eastward, the
waste places.  The trip to the Chippewa
country was a hard one, but Ruth got
through it well enough and Grim remained
constant at our side.  At the Chippewa
villages we parted with Uchichak, and
there still hang upon the wall before me
the magnificent moccasins which he gave
me as a parting gift, while to Ruth was
given a shirt of doeskin with quill workings
in many hues.
</p>

<p>
Brave Heart kept his promises faithfully,
although the Chippewas were bitter against
us for the loss of so large a party, and with
some of his men led us eastward, thinking
to hit upon the Bay and so cross the ice
to Albany.  But to the post we never
came, for we had no sooner come to the
Bay, a desolate waste of ice stretching into
the distance, than we saw a smoke from a
river-mouth, and when we had come to it
found there a ship laid up for the winter,
and near the ship a little fortified camp of
men.
</p>

<p>
I left our party and advanced down the
slope toward them, and when our coming
was seen, a man came forth to meet me,
while over the camp was run up the flag
of France.  The man was also French, and
I greeted him in his own tongue, asking for
refuge and shelter.  He tendered us a warm
greeting, and therewith we went down to
the camp, wondering how this ship of
France came to be in the territory of the
Adventurers.
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><a id="chap22"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XXII.
<br /><br />
THE END OF THE LONG TRAIL.
</h3>

<p>
It was simple enough.  The ship was the
barque Pelican, out of New France, and
her company were fur-pirates in the Bay.
They had been caught by the ice, but as
none at the Company's posts knew of their
presence, they were safe enough.  In the
barque was great store of furs bartered
from the Indians, and her master, one de
Croissac, sought only to win home again
safe ere the Company's ships came from
England in the spring.
</p>

<p>
They were warm-hearted men, these
Frenchmen, and gave us of their best.  I
told de Croissac all our tale, whereat he
marveled much, and promised to take us
safe to Montreal, whence we could get ship
for France or New England, and so home
again.  Moreover, he knew of the de
Courbelles, and that Ruth's heritance was
great.
</p>

<p>
This troubled me no little.  At last
the spring came and the ice went out in
its warmth, and the "Pelican" was ready.
On the day we sailed, Ruth and I stood on
the hilltop above, gazing out across the
land and the water.
</p>

<p>
"Somewhere in that ice-dotted blue,"
Ruth said softly, "sleeps the 'Lass o'
Dee,' with all those whom we knew and
loved, Davie."
</p>

<p>
"Yes," I made heavy-hearted answer,
"and we leave them here for ever.  When
we get to New France, and you become a
great lady, Ruth, I will leave you there
also among your kin, and go&mdash;where I
know not."
</p>

<p>
"Why, Davie," and she slipped her hand
into mine gently, "do you think so hard
of me as to leave me among strangers?  I
had thought we would go back to Ayrby
together&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Lass, lass," I cried out in the old Gaelic
we had not spoke for so long, "an' you
stay in New France you shall be a great
lady, rich and be-suitored.  Would you then
come back to the little stead on the moors,
where wealth is naught, where all is rude
and homely and&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, Davie," she whispered, "because
it is rude and homely and&mdash;beautiful, I love
it.  So you thought I had rather be a great
lady!  Truly, you might have known me
better than that."
</p>

<p>
Aye, and I had, but I had wished for her
to say it.  So we stood for long, until a
gun crashed out from the "Pelican,"
warning us to come.  As we turned to go, I
caught her to me and my heart swelled with
the knowledge that though the New World
had taken much from me, it had in the end
given me more a thousandfold.
</p>

<p>
In the Straits we were sighted by an
English ship, but the "Pelican" was too
fast for her, and not another sail did we
see until we reached New France and were
safe.  De Croissac, who knew our story
and our love, advised that we be married
before seeking out Ruth's people, for were
our story and the ending of Radisson to
become known, there was no telling but that
she might be sent to France as a ward of
the Governor.
</p>

<p>
So it came about that we stepped ashore
and sought out a friend of the kindly captain,
a priest whose little chapel nestled in
the shadow of the citadel, and from which
we went as man and wife, soberly and
happily.
</p>

<p>
Before leaving the Bay, Soan-ge-ta-ha
had conveyed to me a parting gift from
Uchichak and the Crees, in the shape of a
packet of furs.  These I had not opened
until the cargo of the "Pelican" came to
be examined, when it was found that they
were of the choicest beaver and fox, and
that their sale would afford us much ready
money.
</p>

<p>
Thus it chanced that when we left
Montreal for Boston town, aboard a trader
of that port, both Ruth and I were like to
be well off upon our return to the Old
World.  Of the finding of Hudson I had
said nothing, keeping the little Bible and
the scrap of written paper safe stowed
away, for our tale seemed wild enough as
it was, in all sooth.
</p>

<p>
One more package there was, in two
pieces, but very large and bulky.  What
this contained I did not know.  It had been
Ruth's secret from the time we left Uchichak's
village until we reached Rathesby
once again, and so on to the stead at Ayrby,
which Ian MacDonald yielded up readily
enough, being glad to go back to his nets.
At the unpacking of this thing, Ruth bade
me begone for a time.  I returned from the
moors to find, hung over the broad fireplace,
the massy antlers of the Mighty One!
She had fetched them where I had clean
forgot them, to be a lasting memorial of
the days that had been.
</p>

<p>
So here endeth my tale.  There is another
Grim now to tend the sheep, yet still
about us are things whereby to remember
him and his.  But the things we fetched
back from the New World were more than
we had gone to seek there.  We had
dreamed of fortune, and we came home
with love.  We had looked for struggle and
hardship, and we had found them, but we
had come home again with peace.  Ruth,
bending over my shoulder as I write this
last, would have me say one word more of
Radisson&mdash;nay, she shall write it herself,
here at the end.
</p>

<p>
"Trust thou in the Lord, wait patiently
for Him, and He shall give thee thy heart's
desire!"
</p>

(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or

other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means

        &#8226; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are

        &#8226; You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies

        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,

Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
